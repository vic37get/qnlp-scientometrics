Nonetheless, certain computational tasks in drug discovery can be daunting with classical computing techniques which can be potentially overcome using quantum computing. A crucial task within this domain involves the functional classification of proteins. However, a challenge lies in adequately representing lengthy protein sequences given the limited number of qubits available in existing noisy quantum computers. We show that protein sequences can be thought of as sentences in natural language processing and can be parsed using the existing Quantum Natural Language framework into parameterized quantum circuits of reasonable qubits, which can be trained to solve various protein-related machine-learning problems. We classify proteins based on their sub-cellular locations - a pivotal task in bioinformatics that is key to understanding biological processes and disease mechanisms. Leveraging the quantum-enhanced processing capabilities, we demonstrate that Quantum Tensor Networks (QTN) can effectively handle the complexity and diversity of protein sequences. We present a detailed methodology that adapts QTN architectures to the nuanced requirements of protein data, supported by comprehensive experimental results. We demonstrate two distinct QTNs, inspired by classical recurrent neural networks (RNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), to solve the binary classification task mentioned above. Our top-performing quantum model has achieved a 94% accuracy rate, which is comparable to the performance of a classical model that uses the ESM2 protein language model embeddings. It's noteworthy that the ESM2 model is extremely large, containing 8 million parameters in its smallest configuration, whereas our best quantum model requires only around 800 parameters. We demonstrate that these hybrid models exhibit promising performance, showcasing their potential to compete with classical models of similar complexity. © 2024 ACM.","Protein Sequence Classification; Quantum Machine Learning; Quantum Neural Network","Classification (of information); Complex networks; Convolutional neural networks; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Qubits; Recurrent neural networks; Tensors; Drug discovery; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Performance; Protein sequence classification; Protein sequences; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum models; Quantum neural networks; Proteins","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (DGE-1723687, CNS-1722557, DGE-1821766, CCF-1718474, OIA-2040667); National Science Foundation, NSF","We extend our gratitude to Avimita Chatterjee (Pennsylvania State University) for her valuable insights and assistance in structuring the work.

Models like fastText [1], [2], GloVe [3], Numberbatch [4], or BERT [5] are common NLP embedding vectors or models that encode semantic properties of words or text fragments. We use these models to evaluate mapping properties and compression rate, as well as information preservation in quantum embeddings. For mapping embedding vectors to quantum states, we use encoding strategies, such as Amplitude Encoding. The encoding strategies allow us to map large dense vectors from the embedding models to compact quantum states using different compression ratios. The compression with Amplitude Encoding can be 2n to N, resulting in a mapping of a 1,024-dimensional vector of reals in the classical environment to a 10-qubit state. The goal of this work is to evaluate these strategies with respect to their compression ratio and measure the preservation of semantic information using similarity scores. We show that the resulting quantum embeddings based on mapped classical computing embeddings exhibit the same relational properties and that there is no significant loss of semantic information in the conversion from classical n-dimensional real vector embeddings to qubit states. We conclude that the experimental results allow us to quantum compute semantic similarities of words or text, reusing existing and freely available embedding models from classical NLP/AI computing. © 2024 IEEE.","Natural Language Processing; Quantum Embeddings; Semantic Similarity; Word embeddings","Computation theory; Embeddings; Gluing; Human computer interaction; Natural language processing systems; Quantum electronics; Qubits; Semantics; Vectors; Word processing; Embeddings; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Quantum embedding; Quantum state; Real vector; Semantic similarity; Word embedding; Encoding (symbols)","","","","","","","Bojanowski P., Grave E., Joulin A., Mikolov T., Enriching word vectors with subword information, Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 5, pp. 135-146, (2017); Joulin A., Bojanowski P., Mikolov T., Jegou H., Grave E., Loss in translation: Learning bilingual word mapping with a retrieval criterion, Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, (2018); Pennington J., Socher R., Manning C.D., Glove: Global vectors for word representation, Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 1532-1543, (2014); Speer R., Chin J., Havasi C., ConceptNet 5. 5: An open multilingual graph of general knowledge, pp. 4444-4451, (2017); Devlin J., Chang M.-W., Lee K., Toutanova K., BERT: Pretraining of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Lenci A., Sahlgren M., Distributional semantics, (2023); Rath M., Date H., Quantum data encoding: A comparative analysis of classical-to-quantum mapping techniques and their impact on machine learning accuracy, (2023); Buhrman H., Cleve R., Watrous J., De Wolf R., Quantum Fingerprinting, Physical Review Letters, 87, 16, (2001); Araujo I.F., Park D.K., Petruccione F., Da Silva A.J., A divideand-conquer algorithm for quantum state preparation, Scientific Reports, 11, 1, (2021); Pastorello D., Blanzieri E., A quantum binary classifier based on cosine similarity, 2021 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE), pp. 477-478, (2021); Vaswani A., Shazeer N., Parmar N., Uszkoreit J., Jones L., Gomez A.N., Kaiser L., Polosukhin I., Attention is all you need, (2023); Goodfellow I., Bengio Y., Courville A., Deep Learning., (2016)","","Culhane C.; Byrd G.T.; Muller H.; Alexeev Y.; Alexeev Y.; Sheldon S.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","et al.; Keysight; Microsoft; Q-CTRL; QBLOX; Quantinuum","5th IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2024","15 September 2024 through 20 September 2024","Montreal","205980","","979-833154137-8","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Quantum Week , QCE","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217179460"

As the demand for ML solutions continues to rise across the diverse research domains, there exists a critical need for an innovative approach to accelerate ML adoption. In this regard we introduce an Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform designed as an application-agnostic Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) solution. The platform provides a paradigm shift by offering a flexible and generalized infrastructure that decouples the ML development process from the specific use cases. The AI platform is implemented as a software layer on top of our cloud platform: the INFN Cloud, a dedicated, geographically distributed infrastructure which offers composable, scalable, and open-source solutions. The AI platform leverages INFN Cloud resources and principles, gathering and orchestrating technologies to support end-to-end scalable ML solutions: Kubernetes, Kubeflow, KServe, KNative, Kueue, Horovod, etc., ensuring support for several ML frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Apache MXNet, XGBoost, etc. This paper describes the platform’s design and principles, as well as some selected use cases from Natural Language Processing and HEP domains that can take advantage of the “aaS” approach. © Copyright owned by the author(s)","","Adversarial machine learning; BASIC (programming language); Domain Knowledge; Hadrons; Photons; Platform as a Service (PaaS); Problem oriented languages; Domain knowledge; Generation experiments; Genomics; Hard science; High-energy physics; Innovative approaches; Machine-learning; Quantum Computing; Research domains; Work-flows; Cloud platforms","","","","","","","Cloud Services for Research; Kubernetes; Apache Kafka; KServe; KServe; Kubeflow Training Operator; MPI Jobs; MPI Operator; Horovod; Katib; Kueue; Kubernetes Autoscaler; INDIGO PaaS Orchestrator; Infrastructure Manager; MongoDB; MinIO; Longhorn; Open Inference Protocol; Vaswani A., Shazeer N., Parmar N., Uszkoreit J., Jones L., Gomez A.N., Kaiser L., Polosukhin I., Attention is all you need, (2023); A Practitioners Guide to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG); Multilingual E5 Large; Gao L., Ma X., Lin J., Callan J., Precise zero-shot dense retrieval without relevance labels, (2022); Robertson S., Zaragoza H., Found.

This has led to great interest in quantum natural language processing, and several early proposals and experiments. This paper surveys the state of this area, showing how NLP-related techniques have been used in quantum language processing. We examine the art of word embeddings and sequential models, proposing some avenues for future investigation and discussing the tradeoffs present in these directions. We also highlight some recent methods to compute attention in transformer models, and perform grammatical parsing. We also introduce a new quantum design for the basic task of text encoding (representing a string of characters in memory), which has not been addressed in detail before. Quantum theory has contributed toward quantifying uncertainty and explaining “What is intelligence?” In this context, we argue that “hallucinations” in modern artificial intelligence systems are a misunderstanding of the way facts are conceptualized: language can express many plausible hypotheses, of which only a few become actual. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany and Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V. 2024.","QNLP; Quantum AI; Quantum language processing; Quantum string encoding","Economic and social effects; Encoding (symbols); Natural language processing systems; Quantum optics; Signal encoding; 'current; Encodings; Language processing; Natural languages; QNLP; Quanta computers; Quantum AI; Quantum language processing; Quantum string encoding; Quantum strings; Quantum computers","","","","","","","Van Rijsbergen C.J., The Geometry of Information Retrieval, (2004); Sordoni A., Nie J.Y., Bengio Y., Modeling Term Dependencies with Quantum Language Models for IR, In: Proceedings of the 36Th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, SIGIR, 13, pp. 653-662, (2013); Widdows D., Peters S., Word vectors and quantum logic, Proceedings of the Eighth Mathematics of Language Conference, (2003); Clark S., Pulman S., Combining symbolic and distributional models of meaning, AAAI Spring Symposium: Quantum Interaction, pp. 52-55, (2007); Coecke B., Sadrzadeh M., Clark S., Mathematical foundations for a compositional distributional model of meaning., (2010); Coyle B., Mills D., Danos V., Kashefi E., The Born supremacy: quantum advantage and training of an Ising Born machine, npj Quant Inf, 6, 1, pp. 1-11, (2020); Yu Z., Chen Q., Jiao Y., Li Y., Lu X., Wang X., Yang J.Z., Provable Advantage of Parameterized Quantum Circuit in Function Approximation, (2023); Bowles J., Ahmed S., Schuld M., Better than classical?

Decision-making and resource management improve with convergence, enabling new agricultural solutions. This technique solves traditional computing's problems with large datasets and complex language processing, making it crucial for real-time decision-making. Problems include complex quantum algorithms, NLP models in quantum frameworks, and quantum hardware. This study presents Smart Agriculture Computing based on Quantum Natural Language Processing (SAC-QNLP) to overcome the aforesaid challenges. Agricultural data systems use quantum computing, data flow, and quantum-enhanced NLP algorithms. Quantum computing assesses large, complicated datasets faster than standard methods. Thus, smart agricultural strategy apps learn more and forecast better. Increased production projections from genetic and environmental factors SAC-QNLP could change farming. A simulation evaluated SAC-QNLP's performance and scalability. Older methods use more resources, produce less precise data, and are less efficient. The results show SAC-QNLP could boost farming production and sustainability.  © 2024 IEEE.","advanced agricultural solutions; natural language processing; production projection; quantum computing; smart agriculture computing","Quantum electronics; Advanced agricultural solution; Decision making managements; Decision resource management; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Production projection; Quantum Computing; Smart agriculture computing; Smart agricultures; Large datasets","","","","","","","Zhang P., Guo Z., Ullah S., Melagraki G., Afantitis A., Lynch I., Nanotechnology and artificial intelligence to enable sustainable and precision agriculture, Nature Plants, 7, 7, pp. 864-876, (2021); Fountas S., Espejo-Garcia B., Kasimati A., Gemtou M., Panoutsopoulos H., Anastasiou E., Agriculture 5. 0: Cuttingedge technologies, trends, and challenges, IT Professional, 26, 1, pp. 40-47, (2024); Vardhan G.H., Sushanth K., The Future of Entrepreneurship: Employing Artificial Intelligence, Utilizing AI and Smart Technology to Improve Sustainability in Entrepreneurship, pp. 134-151, (2024); Alharbi M., Rajagopal S.K., Rajendran S., Alshahrani M., Plant disease classification based on ConvLSTM U-net with fully connected convolutional layers, Traitement du Signal, 40, 1, (2023); Rahman S.M., Alkhalaf O.H., Alam M.S., Tiwari S.P., Shafiullah M., Al-Judaibi S.M., Al-Ismail F.S., Climate Change Through Quantum Lens: Computing and Machine Learning, Earth Systems and Environment, pp. 1-18, (2024); Mousa N., Shirazi F., A survey analysis of quantum computing adoption and the paradigm of privacy engineering, Security and Privacy, (2024); Raveena S., Surendran R., Sustainable fertilizers in coffee plantation: Hybrid Recommendation for agricultural producers, 2023 5th International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA), pp. 1664-1671, (2023); Selvanarayanan R., Rajendran S., Algburi S., Ibrahim Khalaf O., Hamam H., Empowering coffee farming using counterfactual recommendation based RNN driven IoT integrated soil quality command system, Scientific Reports, 14, 1, (2024); Redhu N.S., Thakur Z., Yashveer S., Mor P., Artificial intelligence: A way forward for agricultural sciences, Bioinformatics in Agriculture, pp. 641-668, (2022); Alazzai W.K., Obaid M.K., Abood B.S.Z., Jasim L., Smart Agriculture Solutions: Harnessing AI and IoT for Crop Management, E3S Web of Conferences, 477, (2024); Gyamfi E.K., ElSayed Z., Kropczynski J., Yakubu M.A., Elsayed N., Agricultural 4. 0 Leveraging on Technological Solutions: Study for Smart Farming Sector, (2024); Veeramanju K.T., Revolutionizing agriculture: A case study of IBM's AI innovations, International Journal of Applied Engineering and Management Letters (IJAEML), 7, 4, pp. 95-114, (2023); Dadi P.S., Tamilvizhi T., Surendran R., Layout optimization for agriculture or small scale agrarian industry, 2022 6th International Conference on Trends in Electronics and Informatics (ICOEI), pp. 174-179, (2022); Selvanarayanan R., Rajendran S., Alotaibi Y., Early Detection of Colletotrichum Kahawae Disease in Coffee Cherry Based on Computer Vision Techniques, CMES-Computer Modeling in Engineering & Sciences, 139, 1, (2024); Saravanan S.K., Nisha F., Rohit V.R., Lenin J., Selvam P.D., Rajmohan M., Impact of Cloud Computing on Agricultural Advancement using Data Mining Algorithms, 2023 2nd International Conference on Automation, Computing and Renewable Systems (ICACRS), pp. 1570-1575, (2023); Krishnan R.S., Raj J.R.F., Christopher V.B., Nandini N., Muthu A.E., Puvanadevi C., Enhancing Agricultural IoT with Predictive Analytics and Reinforcement Learning Models, 2024 International Conference on Integrated Circuits and Communication Systems (ICICACS), pp. 1-6, (2024); Deepa R., Jayalakshmi V., Thilakavathy P., Prabhu A.B., Surendran R., Quantum Machine Learning Techniques based on Nurturing Agri-Ontology Framework in Agricultural Science, 2024 3rd International Conference on Applied Artificial Intelligence and Computing (ICAAIC), pp. 413-420, (2024); Anbuselvan N., Manju A., Anandan P., IoT and Cloud-Based Smart Farming with Optimized Convolutional Neural Networks for Grape Fruit Disease Classification, 2023 International Conference on Data Science, Agents & Artificial Intelligence (ICDSAAI), pp. 1-5, (2023)","G.

We demonstrate various approaches to topic classification. The first uses an explicit word-based approach, in which word-topic weights are implemented as fractional rotations of individual qubits, and a phrase is classified based on the accumulation of these weights onto a scoring qubit, using entangling quantum gates. This is compared with more scalable quantum encodings of word embedding vectors, which are used to compute kernel values in a quantum support vector machine: this approach achieved an average of 62% accuracy on classification tasks involving over 10000 words, which is the largest such quantum computing experiment to date. We describe a quantum probability approach to bigram modeling that can be applied to understand sequences of words and formal concepts, investigate a generative approximation to these distributions using a quantum circuit Born machine, and introduce an approach to ambiguity resolution in verb-noun composition using single-qubit rotations for simple nouns and 2-qubit entangling gates for simple verbs. The smaller systems presented have been run successfully on physical quantum computers, and the larger ones have been simulated. We show that statistically meaningful results can be obtained, but the quality of individual results varies much more using real datasets than using artificial language examples from previous quantum NLP research. Related NLP research is compared, partly with respect to contemporary challenges including informal language, fluency, and truthfulness. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","68T50; 81P68; QNLP; Quantum computing; Quantum natural language processing; Quantum NLP","","","","","","","","Widdows D., A mathematical model for context and word-meaning, International and Interdisciplinary Conference on Modeling and Using Context, pp. 369-382, (2003); Dirac P., The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, 4th edition, 1958, reprinted, (1930); Orrell D., Quantum Economics and Finance: An Applied Mathematics Introduction, (2020); Busemeyer J.R., Bruza P.D., Quantum Models of Cognition and Decision, (2012); Schrodinger E., Discussion of probability relations between separated systems, In: Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, 31, pp. 555-563, (1935); Cooke H.P., Treddenick H., Aristotle: Categories, (1938); Piedeleu R., Kartsaklis D., Coecke B.M., Open system categorical quantum semantics in natural language processing (, (2015); Coecke B., de Felice G., Meichanetzidis K., Toumi A., Foundations for near-term quantum natural language processing (, (2020); Geron A., Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems., (2019); Nielsen M.A., Chuang I., Quantum Computation and Quantum Information.

However, challenges such as language complexity and data limitations persist in natural language processing (NLP). Quantum computing utilizes quantum mechanics to tackle complex language structures with limited data. By integrating quantum computing with LSTM, we can address the issues of linguistic complexity and data scarcity. In this paper, we present a Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) network that comprehends the semantics of textual data.

However, due to the complicated high-dimensional component-property relationship, tuning material properties by researchers’ experience is challenging, even when guided by physical or empirical rules. Here, we adopt quantum computing (QC) technology and machine learning models to provide a proof-of-concept application of QC in physical metallurgy. We propose a quantum support vector machine (QSVM) model to predict single-phase CCAs. We show that fine-tuned quantum kernels with entanglement deliver promising performance, with a maximum accuracy of 89.4%. The QSVM model is then used to identify 1,741 lightweight CCAs jointly with a new text-mining-based method. Meanwhile, we devise a controllable approach to study the effect of noise on model performance and find that the noise level needs to be minimized for high-performance QSVM models. This study provides a practical and general approach to designing CCAs based on quantum technologies. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Alloy design; language models; MAP 2: Benchmark; quantum computer; quantum machine learning","Computational linguistics; Learning systems; Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Support vector machines; Alloy designs; Designing complex; Language model; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; MAP 2: benchmark; Quanta computers; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Support vector machine models; Modeling languages","","","","","International Business Machines Corporation, IBM","This work was supported in part through the NYU IT High Performance Computing resources, services, and staff expertise.

More importantly, it analyses the potentially disruptive impact of this ascendant technology on higher education and the global workplace. The findings of this paper indicate that students pursuing higher education tend to perceive GAI favourably, as it frees them from the toil of rote-learning. However, the view is rather mixed in the case of educators, who are still coming to grips with this seemingly disruptive technology. In the case of the global labour market, GAI has the potential to decimate legions of white-collar jobs once it eliminates inherent issues of biases, security and misinformation. Despite the media's constant labelling of GAI as a disruptive technology that has suddenly burst onto the technological scene, it is evidenced in this paper that the technology has taken nearly eight decades to reach today's level of technological advancement. Further, it is far from reaching its full potential, as it is still incorporating advances in pattern recognition, planning and problem solving, and quantum computing technologies. This study also warns of concentrating the power of this game-changing technology in the hands of a few major corporate titans. © 2024 The Authors","Disruptive; GAI; GPT; LLMs; “AI-optimists”; “AI-sceptics”","","","","","","","","Alhosani K., Alhashmi S.M., Opportunities, challenges, and benefits of AI innovation in government services: a review, Discov.

Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have recently gained much attention due to their ability to generate diverse and high-quality samples in many computer vision tasks, as well as to incorporate flexible model architectures and a relatively simple training scheme. Quantum generative models, empowered by entanglement and superposition, have brought new insight to learning classical and quantum data. Inspired by the classical counterpart, we propose the quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic model (QuDDPM) to enable efficiently trainable generative learning of quantum data. QuDDPM adopts sufficient layers of circuits to guarantee expressivity, while it introduces multiple intermediate training tasks as interpolation between the target distribution and noise to avoid barren plateau and guarantee efficient training. We provide bounds on the learning error and demonstrate QuDDPM's capability in learning correlated quantum noise model, quantum many-body phases, and topological structure of quantum data. The results provide a paradigm for versatile and efficient quantum generative learning.  © 2024 American Physical Society.","","Computer vision; Learning systems; Quantum efficiency; Quantum entanglement; Quantum noise; Topology; De-noising; Enabling technologies; Generative model; High quality; Language model; Machine-learning; Probabilistic models; Quantum data; Quantum machines; Text generations; article; computer vision; controlled study; diffusion; generative model; human; large language model; learning; machine learning; noise; respiratory gas humidifier; Diffusion","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (ONR N00014-23-1-2296, CCF-2240641, DMS-2347760)","Q.\u2009Z. and B.\u2009Z. acknowledge support from NSF CAREER Awards No. CCF-2240641 and No. ONR N00014-23-1-2296.

Already there exist applications running in quantum devices for different areas, like cybersecurity, chemistry, or machine learning. One subarea being developed under quantum machine learning is quantum natural language processing. Following the promising results existing in problems like sentiment classification or next-word prediction, this paper presents two proofs of concept to demonstrate how these two tasks can be solved using quantum computing. For the first task showcased, sentiment classification, we employ the removal of caps and cups morphisms to make the string diagrams simpler and more efficient. In the case of next-word prediction, we show how to solve the task for sentences with previously unknown syntactic structures by applying a classical Random Forest machine learning algorithm that classifies the syntactic structure and enables our QNLP algorithm to infer the proper string model. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Quantum computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum natural language processing","Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Syntactics; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum natural language processing; Sentiment classification; Syntactic structure; Word prediction; Machine learning","","","","","","","Bauer C.W., Freytsis M., Nachman B., Simulating Collider Physics on Quantum Computers Using Effective Field Theories, (2021); Bennett C.H., Brassard G., Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing, Theor.

We re-implement a key representative set of these existing methods, adapting an image classification approach using quantum self-attention to create a quantum hybrid transformer that works for text and image classification, and applying quantum self-attention and quantum recurrent neural networks to natural language processing tasks. We also explore different encoding techniques and introduce positional encoding into quantum self-attention neural networks leading to improved accuracy and faster convergence in text and image classification experiments. This paper also performs a comparative analysis of classical self-attention models and their quantum counterparts, helping shed light on the differences in these models and their performance.  © 2024 IEEE.","quantum-computing; quantum-machine-learning; self-attention; transformers","Classification (of information); Encoding (symbols); Image classification; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Signal encoding; Text processing; Images classification; Machine-learning; Primary objective; Quantum Computing; Quantum machines; Quantum-machine-learning; Self-attention; Sequence models; Text classification; Transformer; Recurrent neural networks","","","","","","","Sutskever I., Vinyals O., Le Q.V., Sequence to sequence learning with neural networks, Advances in neural information processing systems, (2014); Schmidt R.M., Recurrent neural networks (rnns): A gentle introduction and overview, (2019); Vaswani A., Et al., Attention is All you Need, Neural Information Processing Systems, (2017); Hochreiter S., Schmidhuber J., Long short-term memory, Neural computation, 9, 8, pp. 1735-1780, (1997); Cho K., Et al., Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for statistical machine translation, (2014); Devlin J., Et al., Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, (2018); Radford A., Narasimhan K., Salimans T., Sutskever I., Et al., Improving language understanding by generative pre-training, (2018); Huang H.-Y., Et al., Quantum advantage in learning from experiments, Science, 376, pp. 1182-1186, (2022); Schuld M., Supervised Learning with Quantum Computers, (2018); Zoufal C., Lucchi A., Woerner S., Quantum generative adversarial networks for learning and loading random distributions, npj Quant.

This paper focuses on training Code LLMs to specialize in the field of quantum computing. We begin by discussing the unique needs of quantum computing programming, which differ significantly from classical programming approaches or languages. A Code LLM specializing in quantum computing requires a foundational understanding of quantum computing and quantum information theory. However, the scarcity of available quantum code examples and the rapidly evolving field, which necessitates continuous dataset updates, present significant challenges. Moreover, we discuss our work on training Code LLMs to produce high-quality quantum code using the Qiskit library. This work includes an examination of the various aspects of the LLMs used for training and the specific training conditions, as well as the results obtained with our current models. To evaluate our models, we have developed a custom benchmark, similar to HumanEval, which includes a set of tests specifically designed for the field of quantum computing programming using Qiskit. Our findings indicate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in quantum computing tasks. We also provide examples of code suggestions, comparing our model to other relevant code LLMs. Finally, we introduce a discussion on the potential benefits of Code LLMs for quantum computing computational scientists, researchers, and practitioners. We also explore various features and future work that could be relevant in this context.  © 2024 IEEE.","Code Large Language Models; code LLMs; Qiskit; Quantum Computing","Benchmarking; Computer software selection and evaluation; Quantum electronics; Turbo codes; Classical programming; Code large language model; Code LLM; Coding process; Computing codes; Language model; Qiskit; Quantum codes; Quantum Computing; Training codes; Application programs","","","","","","","Zheng Z., Et al., A survey of large language models for code: Evolution, benchmarking, and future trends, (2023); (2024); GPT-4 Technical Report, OpenAI, (2023); Anthropic, (2024); Reid M., Et al., Gemini 1. 5: Unlocking multimodal understanding across millions of tokens of context, (2024); Lozhkov A., Et al., StarCoder 2 and The Stack v2: The Next Generation, (2024); Roziere B., Et al., Code Llama: Open Foundation Models for Code, (2023); Guo D., Et al., DeepSeek-Coder: When the Large Language Model Meets Programming-The Rise of Code Intelligence, (2024); Preskill J., Quantum computing in the NISQ era and beyond, Quantum, 2, (2018); Biamonte J., Et al., Quantum machine learning, Nature, 549, 7671, pp. 195-202, (2017); Bharti K., Et al., Machine learning meets quantum foundations: A brief survey, AVS Quantum Science, 2, 3, (2020); Peral-Garcia D., Et al., Systematic literature review: Quantum machine learning and its applications, Computer Science Review, 51, (2024); Dunjko V., Et al., Machine learning & artificial intelligence in the quantum domain: A review of recent progress, Reports on Progress in Physics, 81, 7, (2018); Emani P.S., Et al., Quantum computing at the frontiers of biological sciences, Nature Methods, 18, 7, pp. 701-709, (2021); Martonosi M., Et al., Next steps in quantum computing: Computer science's role, (2019); Baireuther P., Et al., Machine-learning-assisted correction of correlated qubit errors in a topological code, Quantum, 2, (2018); Bausch J., Et al., Learning to decode the surface code with a recurrent, transformer-based neural network, (2023); Nautrup H.P., Et al., Optimizing quantum error correction codes with reinforcement learning, Quantum, 3, (2019); Nguyen V., Et al., Deep reinforcement learning for efficient measurement of quantum devices, npj Quantum Information, 7, 1, (2021); Kremer D., Et al., Practical and efficient quantum circuit synthesis and transpiling with reinforcement learning, (2024); Esbroeck V., Et al., Quantum device fine-tuning using unsupervised embedding learning, New Journal of Physics, 22, 9, (2020); Moon H., Et al., Machine learning enables completely automatic tuning of a quantum device faster than human experts, Nature communications, 11, 1, (2020); Cruz-Benito J., Et al., A deep-learning-based proposal to aid users in quantum computing programming, Learning and Collaboration Technologies.

The integration of QCs and DL undoubtedly represent one such transformative means for improving Natural Language Processing (NLP). By combining the two, this uses quantum principles of superposition and entanglement to make computation faster regarding human language comprehension limitations in classical computing. Deep learning models, specifically neural networks have already made significant improvements over NLP tasks like language translations, sentiment analysis and text generation. Nevertheless, these models also face scalability and computational efficiency issues with huge volumes of data. Quantum computing offers a solution to all this by reducing the time exponentially that it takes to fetch large amounts of language data and running deep learning algorithms. This paper investigates the opportunities that integrating quantum computing and deep learning into NLP practices might unlock. We drafted the fundamentals of quantum computing and why it is a need over classical computing, where we discussed on how quantum beneficial for data processing & optimization of an algorithm. We then explore applications of quantum enhanced deep learning for NLP, with a focus on the impact that training and inference can have on model performance. We demonstrate the utility of this integration by integrating our four SQDs to showcase improvements on diverse NLP tasks through a series of experiments and case studies. We also demonstrate that hybrid quantum-classical approaches allow the combination of traditional ML and quantum-enhanced models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with respect to effectiveness, scalability and precision. © 2024 IEEE.","Algorithm Optimization;

That stated, there are problems with the consistency and fictitiousness of the evaluations because there are numerous fake or fraudulent ones. These misleading assessments are generated during the investigation in an attempt to mislead customers about the nature of a real advantage, compromising their ability to make a predetermined decision and damaging the reputations of businesses. A cutting-edge interrogation department revealed that quantum machine learning (QML) could manage a huge amount of machine-trained data and could convey almost emotional choices in the context of inaccurate checks. It is truly beneficial in obtaining reviews for things that are incorrect. Opinion, generating trends, interpersonal relationships, and assessing fatigue is merely a few of the attributes. Tests conducted utilizing the Amazon fraudulent review. The dataset demonstrates that QML tactics outperform conventional knowledge acquisition procedures in errands, including the place of fraudulent reviews. The delicacy and tolerance of incorrect review distinguishing evidence can be significantly advanced, although QML is still in its early stages of development. Both our proposed model and model pass rigorous conventional machine learning algorithms testing with a remarkable level of accuracy. An article introduces a unique approach to fraudulent review detection and brings in the QNN algorithm as a solution. A deep learning model, such as this one, has an 86% accuracy rate in quantum computer implementation, which is an impressive level of innovation, especially if it comes with successful results. Involvement in these cutting-edge technologies promises significant benefits in battling the problem of false identities on the Web. In our case, the experimental results demonstrate that our QNN algorithm, which can accurately identify fake reviews, will become a key weapon for suppressing various forms of fraudulence on emerging digital technology platforms. © The Author(s) 2024.","Convolution neural networks (CNN); E-commerce; Fake reviews; Fraud detection; Quantum machine learning (QML); Quantum neural networks (QNN); Sentiment analysis; User behaviour","","","","","","","","Chen A., Lu Y., Wang B., Customers’ purchase decision-making process in social commerce: a social learning perspective, Int J Inf Manag, 37, 6, pp. 627-638, (2017); Wu Y., Et al., Fake online reviews: literature review, synthesis, and directions for future research, Decis Support Syst, 132, (2020); Alchieri L., Et al., An introduction to quantum machine learning: from quantum logic to quantum deep learning, Quantum Mach Intell, 3, pp. 1-30, (2021); Khakhar J., Data Graphics and Interactive Information Environments, (2008); Grant M.J., Booth A., A typology of reviews: an analysis of 14 review types and associated methodologies, Health Inform Libr J, 26, 2, pp. 91-108, (2009); Qu Z., Et al., QMFND: a quantum multimodal fusion-based fake news detection model for social media, Inform Fusion, 104, (2024); Zeguendry A., Jarir Z., Quafafou M., Quantum machine learning: a review and case studies, Entropy, 25, 2, (2023); Singamaneni K., Kumar A.K., Budati (2024) and Thulasi Bikku.

Natural language processing, synthesis, and multimodal data fusion have all been significantly aided by these models, which are based on deep learning architectures. In this study, we set out to investigate the theoretical depths and complex behaviors of these big language models to better understand their potential and limitations. We start by investigating the theoretical underpinnings of the models' construction and operation. We go into their capability to understand context and create coherent language, and we unveil the complexities of its design, from Transformers to attention processes. The dynamic growth of these models, which have moved beyond linguistic barriers to accommodate multimodal input, is discussed along with the use of pre-trained embeddings and transfer learning. We also look at how these models perform in a wide range of contexts, from NLP to computer vision and beyond. We look at the difficulties of biases and fairness in interpreting them and in applying them. We gain understanding of how they might be improved upon in terms of performance, robustness, and scalability. At the heart of this investigation is a suggested strategy for making the most of big language models and their multimodal relatives. To uncover these models' untapped potential and underlying biases, this unique method combines Layer Weight Analysis, Attention Mechanism Analysis, and Ethical Bias Detection. Our results show the impressive efficacy of these models in tackling difficult real-world issues, but they also highlight the critical necessity to address issues of interpretability and fairness.  © 2024 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Data Science; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Quantum Computing; Robotics; Sustainability; Technology; Virtual Reality; Wireless Communication","Computational linguistics; Data fusion; Deep learning; E-learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Robotics; Sustainable development; Language model; Language processing; Machine-learning; Multi-modal; Multimodal data fusion; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Quantum Computing; Technology; Wireless communications; Virtual reality","","","","","","","Barman D., Chowdhury N., A novel semi supervised approach for text classification, International Journal of Information Technology, 12, 4, pp. 1147-1157, (2020); Sahu H., Kashyap R., Dewangan B.K., Hybrid Deep learning based Semi-supervised Model for Medical Imaging, 2022 OPJU International Technology Conference on Emerging Technologies for Sustainable Development (OTCON), pp. 1-6, (2023); Mohanakurup V., Et al., Breast Cancer Detection on Histopathological Images Using a Composite Dilated Backbone Network, Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2022, pp. 1-10, (2022); Kashyap R., Stochastic Dilated Residual Ghost Model for Breast Cancer Detection, J Digit Imaging, 36, pp. 562-573, (2023); Li T., Identifying security requirements based on linguistic analysis and machine learning, Proceedings of the 2017 24th Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC), pp. 388-397, (2017); Malhotra R., Chug A., Hayrapetian A., Raje R., Analyzing and evaluating security features in software requirements, Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Innovation and Challenges in Cyber Security (ICICCS-INBUSH), pp. 26-30, (2016); De Rosa G.H., Roder M., Santos D.F., Costa K.A., Enhancing anomaly detection through restricted Boltzmann machine features projection, International Journal of Information Technology, 13, 1, pp. 49-57, (2021); Pathak D., Kashyap R., Rahamatkar S., A study of deep learning approach for the classification of Electroencephalogram (EEG) brain signals, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for EDGE Computing, pp. 133-144, (2022); Pathak D., Kashyap R., Electroencephalogram-based deep learning framework for the proposed solution of e-learning challenges and limitations, International Journal of Intelligent Information and Database Systems, 15, 3, (2022); Bavkar D.M., Kashyap R., Khairnar V., Multimodal sarcasm detection via hybrid classifier with optimistic logic, Journal of Telecommunications and Information Technology, 3, pp. 97-114, (2022); Ramirez-Asis E., Bolivar R.P., Gonzales L.A., Chaudhury S., Kashyap R., Alsanie W.F., Viju G.K., A Lightweight Hybrid Dilated Ghost Model-Based Approach for the Prognosis of Breast Cancer, Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2022, pp. 1-10, (2022); Shukla P.K., Roy V., Shukla P.K., Chaturvedi A.K., Saxena A.K., Maheshwari M., Pal P.R., An Advanced EEG Motion Artifacts Eradication Algorithm, The Computer Journal, (2021); Ngarianto H., Purwanto E.S., Andrean H., Cultivation of Flowerhorn Species in Search of Superior Quality Seeds using IoT and Open CV, Int J Emerg Technol Adv Eng, 12, 12, pp. 75-83, (2022); Arshad A., Tiwari V., Lovanshi M., Shrivastava R., Role identification from human activity videos using recurrent neural networks, 2022 IEEE International Women in Engineering (WIE) Conf. on Electrical and Computer Engineering (WIECON-ECE), pp. 356-361, (2022); Mohapatra T., Mishra S.S., Bathre M., Sahoo S.S., Taguchi and ANN-based optimization method for predicting maximum performance and minimum emission of a VCR diesel engine powered by diesel, biodiesel, and producer gas, World J.

In this paper, we show an application of quantum models as probability calibrators to language models in Question and Answering (Q &A) tests. Our experiments show comparable results relative to the baseline Q &A models on all metrics. Here, we show another application of this class of models as confidence calibrators, where the parametrized quantum circuit receives a set of features coming from the language model and has to output a corrected confidence measure. The idea is to have a quantum model tell us when the language model is generating good answers or not. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Natural language processing; Quantum machine learning; Question Answering","Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Language model; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum models; Quantum neural networks; Question Answering; Computational linguistics","","","","","National Institute of Science and Technology for Quantum Information, (2013/07375-0, 2014/12236-1, 2019/07665-4, 2019/18287-0, 308529/2021-9, INCT-IQ 465469/2014-0); Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N62909-24-1-2012); Office of Naval Research, ONR; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2021/04655-8, 2021/12407-4, 2023/04987-6); Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (303854/2022-7); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","RCG acknowledges support from National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), project number 303854/2022-7, and also from Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP), project number 2021/12407-4.

Sarcasm, emotion, and sentiment are related to each other, and hence any multitask model could be an effective way to leverage the interdependence among these tasks. In order to better represent these clandestine associations, we avoid solely relying on traditional machine learning methods to encode the relationships between the modalities. In this article, we propose a hybrid quantum model that banks upon the low computational complexity and robust representational power of a variational quantum circuit (VQC) and the tried and tested dense neural network to tackle sentiment, emotion, and sarcasm classification simultaneously. We empirically establish that the quantum properties like superposition, entanglement, and interference will better capture and replicate not only the cross-modal interactions between text, acoustics, and visuals but also the correlations between the three responses. We consider the extended MUStARD dataset to evaluate our proposed hybrid model. The results show that our proposed hybrid quantum framework yields more promising results for the primary task of sarcasm detection with the help of the two secondary classification tasks, viz. sentiment and emotion. © 2014 IEEE.","Hybrid quantum-classical neural network; multimodal data; quantum machine learning","Complex networks; Job analysis; Machine learning; Modal analysis; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Classical neural networks; Hybrid quantum-classical neural network; Interference; Machine-learning; Multi-modal data; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum state; Quantum system; Quantum-classical; Task analysis; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Grover L.K., Quantum computation and quantum information, Am.

Nonetheless, the potential of natural language processing in the quantum paradigm (QNLP) is yet to be explored, including for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) machines. To explore the QNLP frontier, we introduce LEXIQL, a novel noise-aware QNLP technique for text classification on NISQ quantum machines. LEXIQL employs an incremental data injection approach to process textual data in a quantum circuit. It also develops new and effective training methods, such as leveraging a diverse mix of expressible and shallow quantum circuits for the QNLP task of text classification. Our extensive evaluation using Yelp, IMDB, and Amazon datasets (along with synthetic QLNP datasets) demonstrates the effectiveness of LEXIQL's noise-aware design in both ideal and noisy environments. © 2024 IEEE.","Natural Language Processing; Quantum Computing; Quantum Machine Learning","Adversarial machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Quantum electronics; Incremental data; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Text classification; Quantum computers","","","","","Rice University; Northeastern University, NU; National Science Foundation, NSF, (2144540, 2124897, 1910601); National Science Foundation, NSF; Office of Science, SC, (DE-AC05-00OR22725); Office of Science, SC","We thank the reviewers for their constructive feedback.

In the classification task, we utilized an amplitude encoding algorithm and achieved perfect accuracy on the lambeq dataset discussed in literature. We obtained accuracy from 55% to 72.5% on the more complex and realistic Amazon review dataset. This is a reasonable result given the current state-of-the-art results in QNLP. Additionally, when using vector dimension reduction for embeddings, we found that UMAP leads to the best results in our experiment setting. All classification results were done on the default. qubit simulator in pennylane 0. 36 python library. Our classification results highlight the potential of quantum algorithms in practical applications. In the disambiguation task, we selected 18 ambiguous nouns, 32 unambiguous nouns, and 18 different verbs. Our experiments using the QASM simulator within the qiskit Python library demonstrated that the simulator could perfectly differentiate between the various meanings of ambiguous nouns in different contexts. Furthermore, we extended our study to a real quantum device, the ibm-kyoto quantum computer. There, we tested our disambiguation approach on a subset of 4 random nouns (2 ambiguous and 2 unambiguous) and observed that ibm-kyoto could achieve an accuracy range of 82.1% to 98.9% in disambiguation tasks, extending the datasets and improving the results of existing ambiguity resolution experiments [1]. Our work demonstrates the capability of quantum computing in dealing with real-world NLP tasks, hence contributing to the advancement of both OML and NLP. © 2024 IEEE.","Natural Language Processing; Semantics; Sentiment Analysis; Supervised Machine Learning","Natural language processing systems; Network security; Problem oriented languages; Python; Quantum electronics; Quantum entanglement; Self-supervised learning; Semantics; Semi-supervised learning; Ambiguity resolution; Classification results; Classification tasks; Encoding algorithms; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Sentiment analysis; Supervised machine learning; Text classification; Quantum computers","","","","","","","Widdows D., Alexander A., Zhu D., Zimmerman C., Majumder A., Near-Term Advances in Quantum Natural Language Processing, Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, (2024); Shor P.W., Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Prime Factorization and Discrete Logarithms on a Quantum Computer, SIAM Journal on Computing, 26, 5, pp. 1484-1509, (1997); Grover L.K., A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for database search, Proceedings of the Twenty-Eighth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, ser.

The number of people able to use quantum computing is however still very small. This limitation comes from the difficulty to understand the concepts and to know how to start coding. Therefore, there is a need for tools that can assist non-expert in overcoming this complexity. One possibility would be to use existing conversational agents. Unfortunately ChatGPT and other Large-Language Models produce inaccurate results.This article presents C4Q, a chatbot that answers accurately basic questions and guides users when trying to code quantum programs. Contrary to other approaches C4Q uses a pre-trained large language model only to discover and classify user requests. It then generates an accurate answer using an own engine. Thanks to this architectural design, C4Q's answers are always correct, and thus C4Q can become a support tool that makes quantum computing more available to non-experts.  © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Using Lambeq, an open-source library for quantum NLP, we focus on sentiment classification tasks to evaluate the impact of noisy quantum models. Our study involves the application of three types of optimizers: Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), Nelder-Mead, and Adam. The performance and resilience of these optimizers are assessed under various noise conditions to determine their effectiveness in maintaining model accuracy and stability. The research shows that the Adam optimizer outperforms SPSA and NelderMead in QNLP simple sentiment analysis tasks, both in noiseless and noisy environments. Adam achieved 96.67 % accuracy in noiseless conditions, significantly higher than SPSA's 83.33 % and Nelder-Mead's 53.33%, highlighting its superior performance in optimizing quantum circuits. Moreover, in noisy simulation, Adam outperforms others with 70.00% accuracy performance. The work is useful for NLP implementations in quantum computers.

The metrics we focus on are latency (i.e., the execution time), cost (i.e., a value of how expensive the query is in total), and cardinality (i.e., the number of rows in the result table). The critical link between QNLP and the database problem lies in using grammars, such as context-free grammar. Both natural language and SQL queries admit grammatical presentations, which allow us to develop a comprehensive framework for applying QNLP methods to solve the query estimation problem. The model comprises an encoding mechanism and a training phase, integrating classical and quantum subroutines. The encoding mechanism transforms SQL queries into parametrized quantum circuits as in QNLP. Classical optimization algorithms optimize the circuit parameters during training to predict query metrics. Comparing our model to the QNLP models, our model achieves accuracy comparable to the QNLP model in binary classification tasks. Additionally, we expand upon previous research by implementing multi-class classification tasks and comparing the cardinality estimation results to those of state-of-the-art databases. Our theoretical analysis of the quantum machine learning model includes calculations of its expressibility and entangling capabilities. The analysis reveals that the model possesses beneficial properties, making it suitable to be executed on near-term quantum hardware. © 2024 IEEE.","grammars; quantum machine learning; quantum natural language processing; relational databases; SQL","Context free grammars; Context sensitive grammars; Formal languages; Natural language processing systems; Problem oriented languages; Quantum electronics; Query languages; Relational database systems; Structured Query Language; Grammar; Language processing; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum natural language processing; Relational Database; SQL query; Subroutines","","","","","","","Lan H., Bao Z., Peng Y., A survey on advancing the DBMS query optimizer: Cardinality estimation, cost model, and plan enumeration, Data Science and Engineering, 6, 1, pp. 86-101, (2021); Schonberger M., Applicability of quantum computing on database query optimization, Proceedings of the 2022 International Conference on Management of Data., pp. 2512-2514, (2022); Uotila V., Synergy between quantum computers and databases, Proceedings of the VLDB 2022 PhD Workshop co-located with the 48th International Conference on Very Large Databases (VLDB 2022), 3186, (2022); Trummer I., Koch C., Multiple query optimization on the d-wave 2x adiabatic quantum computer, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 9, 9, pp. 648-659, (2016); Schonberger M., Scherzinger S., Mauerer W., Ready to leap (by co-design). join order optimisation on quantum hardware, Proc.

Indeed, as the intricacy of our scientific inquiries has grown, so too has the computational prowess we seek to deploy in our pursuit of answers. As we enter the Exascale era, this mini-review surveys the computational landscape from both the point of view of the development of new and ever more powerful systems, and the simulations that are run on them. Moreover, as we stand on the cusp of a transformative phase in computational biology, this article offers a contemplative glance into the future, speculating on the profound implications of artificial intelligence and quantum computing for large-scale biomolecular simulations. © 2024 The Author(s)","","Artificial Intelligence; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Quantum Theory; artificial intelligence; bioinformatics; computer analysis; high throughput analysis; information processing; large language model; mathematical computing; molecular dynamics; quantum mechanics; Review; computer simulation; procedures; quantum theory","","","","","","","Schlick T., Portillo-Ledesma S., Myers C.G., Beljak L., Chen J., Dakhel S., Darling D., Ghosh S., Hall J., Jan M., Et al., Biomolecular modeling and simulation: a prospering multidisciplinary field, Annu Rev Biophys, 50, pp. 267-301, (2021); Karplus M., Lavery R., Significance of molecular dynamics simulations for life sciences, ISR J Chem, 54, pp. 1042-1051, (2014); Galvanetto N., Ivanovic M.T., Chowdhury A., Sottini A., Nuesch M.F., Nettels D., Best R.B., Schuler B., Extreme dynamics in a biomolecular condensate, Nature, 619, pp. 876-883, (2023); Gara A., Moreira J.E., IBM Blue gene supercomputer, Encyclopedia of parallel computing, pp. 891-900, (2011); Shaw D.E., Deneroff M.M., Dror R.O., Kuskin J.S., Larson R.H., Salmon J.K., Young C., Batson B., Bowers K.J., Chao J.C., Et al., Anton, a special-purpose machine for molecular dynamics simulation, Commun ACM, 51, pp. 91-97, (2008); Anton 2: raising the bar for performance and programmability in a special-purpose molecular dynamics supercomputer, SC '14: proceedings of the international conference for high performance computing, networking, storage and Analysis, pp. 41-53, (2014); Shaw D.E., Adams P.J., Azaria A., Bank J.A., Batson B., Bell A., Bergdorf M., Bhatt J., Butts J.A., Correia T., Et al., Anton 3: twenty microseconds of molecular dynamics simulation before lunch, Proceedings of the international conference for high performance computing, networking, storage and Analysis, pp. 1-11, (2021); Bergman K., Borkar S., Campbell D., Carlson W., Dally W., Denneau M., Franzon P., Harrod W., Hill K., Hiller J., Et al., Exascale computing study: technology challenges in achieving exascale systems, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Information Processing Techniques Office (DARPA IPTO), Tech Rep, 15, (2008); Oak Ridge leadership computing facility; On the Verge of Exascale, the World's Fastest Petascale System Points the Way.

An emergent application of Quantum Machine Intelligence (QMI) is Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP). This paper proposes a multi-dimensional, finite automaton model for quantum word embedding (QWE) via the Galois field. We demonstrated the model to three applications: (1) English vocabulary, (2) amino acid-based genetic codes, and (3) DNA-based genetic codes. The numerical results obtained from the proposed algorithm for the English vocabulary indicate that it produces more representative word features than Word2Vec based on the word distance metric. Second, the proposed algorithm is also utilized to model RNA-Protein interaction based on the latent distance of a given molecule, which is demonstrated on three large datasets, namely RPI369, RPI1807, and RPI2241. Finally, two embedding techniques for DNA-based genetic codes are proposed in this work: Two-state Lackadaisical Encoding (TCE) and Topological-Cyclic Encoding (TLE). These techniques enable extracting relevant features for the efficacy score of gRNAs used in the CRISPR-Cas 9 system, demonstrated on 15 datasets, compared to 12 mathematical features.

In recent times, it has been employed to solve complex problems in domains such as image processing, healthcare, drug discovery, natural language processing and finance. The advantages of QML algorithms over traditional ML models include reduced computation resources and the ability to handle and solve complex problems as well as multiple parameters. In this study, we employ QML models for lung cancer prediction in the smart healthcare system domain. We adopted QML approaches, i.e., VQC and Pegasos QSVC, to improve the detection efficiency of lung cancer. We used different performance parameters, such as training accuracy and statistical measures, to evaluate the QML models and also performed a comparative study with the existing baseline models. We analyse that the Pegasos QSVC model outperforms other QML models with a classification accuracy of 85%. © 2024 IEEE.","lung cancer; Pegasos quantum health-care 4.0; quantum computing; Quantum machine learning; quantum mechanics; smart healthcare system","Adversarial machine learning; Diseases; Electronic health record; Quantum electronics; Cancer prediction; Complex problems; Lung Cancer; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Pegaso quantum health-care 4.0; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Smart healthcare systems; Lung cancer","","","","","","","American cancer society, (2021); Travis W., Brambilla E., Noguchi M., Nicholson A., Geisinger K., Yatabe Y., Beer D., Powell C., Riely G., Van Schil P., Garg K., Austin J., Asamura H., Rusch V., Hirsch F., Scagliotti G., Mitsudomi T., Huber R., Ishikawa Y., Yankelewitz D., International association for the study of lung cancer/American thoracic society/european respiratory society international multidisciplinary classification of lung adenocarcinoma, Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, 6, pp. 244-285, (2011); Gould M.K., Donington J., Lynch W.R., Mazzone P.J., Midthun D.E., Naidich D.P., Wiener R.S., Evaluation of individuals with pulmonary nodules: When is it lung cancer: Diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American college of chest physicians evidencebased clinical practice guidelines, Chest, 143, 5, pp. e93S-e120S, (2013); Schneider J., Tumor markers in detection of lung cancer, 42, pp. 1-41, (2006); Reduced lung-cancer mortality with low-dose computed tomographic screening, New England Journal of Medicine, 365, 5, pp. 395-409, (2011); Chaudhary A., Singh S.S., Lung cancer detection on ct images by using image processing, 2012 International Conference on Computing Sciences, pp. 142-146, (2012); Rahane W., Dalvi H., Magar Y., Kalane A., Jondhale S., Lung cancer detection using image processing and machine learning healthcare, 2018 International Conference on Current Trends towards Converging Technologies (ICCTCT), pp. 1-5, (2018); Tekade R., Rajeswari K., Lung cancer detection and classification using deep learning, 2018 Fourth International Conference on Computing Communication Control and Automation (ICCUBEA), pp. 1-5, (2018); Avramouli M., Savvas I., Garani G., Vasilaki A., Quantum machine learning: Current state and challenges, 25th Pan-Hellenic Conference on Informatics, PCI 2021, pp. 397-402, (2022); Hancco-Quispe J., Borda-Colque J., Torres Cruz F., Quantum machine learning applied to the classification of diabetes, (2022); Jui T., Ayoade O., Rivas P., Orduz J., Performance analysis of quantum machine learning classifiers, NeurIPS 2021 Workshop LatinX in AI, (2021); Dataset; Shalev-Shwartz S., Singer Y., Srebro N., Cotter A., Pegasos: Primal estimated sub-gradient solver for SVM, Math.

One emerging subarea in quantum machine learning is quantum natural language processing, which combines quantum computing advantages and speedups with language processing algorithms to create and perform natural language tasks such as text classification or generation. The libraries and toolboxes used in this subarea include DisCoPy and lambeq, which are used to transform sentences into string diagrams or monoidal functors, convert these diagrams into quantum circuits or ansatz and embed it into a quantum model. In this study, we used both libraries with different text-based datasets to perform sentiment analysis via classification. To do so, we create synthetic datasets to train the different models. After we obtain satisfactory results, we test the resulting models with known datasets. Despite its promising results, quantum natural language processing is far from achieving its full potential. To achieve this potential, the quantum software and hardware must be improved to make them suitable for use with more extensive and complex datasets and other tasks. © 2024 The Author(s)","Quantum computing;

Effective communication is crucial for robots to be seen as “caring”, necessitating advanced mechatronic design and natural language processing (NLP). This paper examines the potential of humanoid robots to autonomously replicate compassionate care. The study employs computational simulations using mathematical and agent-based modeling to analyze human–robot interactions (HRIs) surpassing Tetsuya Tanioka’s TRETON. It incorporates stochastic elements (through neuromorphic computing) and quantum-inspired concepts (through the lens of Martha Rogers’ theory), running simulations over 100 iterations to analyze complex behaviors. Multisensory simulations (visual and audio) demonstrate the significance of “dynamic communication”, (relational) “entanglement”, and (healthcare system and robot’s function) “superpositioning” in HRIs. Quantum and neuromorphic computing may enable humanoid robots to empathetically respond to human emotions, based on Jean Watson’s ten caritas processes for creating transpersonal states. Autonomous AI humanoid robots will redefine the norms of “caring”. Establishing “pluralistic agreements” through open discussions among stakeholders worldwide is necessary to align innovations with the values of compassionate care within a “posthumanist” framework, where the compassionate care provided by Level 4 robots meets human expectations. Achieving compassionate care with autonomous AI humanoid robots involves translating nursing, communication, computer science, and engineering concepts into robotic care representations while considering ethical discourses through collaborative efforts. Nurses should lead the design and implementation of AI and robots guided by “technological knowing” in Rozzano Locsin’s TCCN theory. © 2024 by the author.","aerospace nursing; agent-based modeling; AI; compassionate care; data sonification; HRI; Jean Watson; Martha Rogers; multisensory simulation; neuromorphic computing; nurse robots; nursing; posthumanism; quantum computing; robot proxies; robotics; space robots; TCCN; TRETON","","","","","","","","Nakano Y., Tanioka T., Yokotani T., Ito H., Miyagawa M., Yasuhara Y., Betriana F., Locsin R., Nurses’ perception regarding patient safety climate and quality of health care in general hospitals in Japan, J.

This capability makes it applicable in various fields, such as natural language processing, image processing, and computer vision. Deep learning models show effective performance but face challenges such as complexity and resource demands. On the other hand, quantum machine learning algorithms offer an alternative with potential efficiency compared to their classical counterparts. This paper proposes a Quantum Recurrent Neural Network (QRNN) for natural language processing tasks, which classify text data such as parts of speech, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. The proposed method utilizes parameterized quantum circuits that contain the tunable parameters. Our approach uses amplitude encoding to represent classical data into quantum states, partial measurement for label determination, and ancilla qubits to transfer the information from the current state to the next. © 2024 Instituto Politecnico Nacional.

Among them, quantum generative models, as a type of unsupervised machine learning, have been proven to learn distributions that are outside of classical machine learning reach. However, there is limited work on how to truly utilize and validate a possible quantum advantage in practical applications, especially in the field of natural language processing. This paper proposes the first Quantum Topic Model (QTM) based on variational quantum circuits to validate and showcase the possible advantages of quantum computing for generative models. QTM not only generates random samples like generative models but also exhibits fitting capabilities similar to neural networks. Finally, we conducted experiments on real datasets, and the results showed that QTM achieved a 46.9% reduction in model parameters while obtaining 10.4% higher topic coherence and 0.2% higher topic diversity with fewer iterations than neural topic models. © 2024 IEEE.","and generative model; natural language processing; Quantum machine learning; topic model; variational quantum circuit","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Generative adversarial networks; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Quantum efficiency; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Unsupervised learning; And generative model; Generative model; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Quantum circuit; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Topic Modeling; Variational quantum circuit; Quantum computers","","","","","TJU-Wenge; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62276188); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work is supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China (grant No. 62276188), TJU-Wenge joint laboratory funding.","Deng L., Du X., Shen J.-Z., Web page classification based on heterogeneous features and a combination of multiple classifiers, Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering, 21, 7, pp. 995-1004, (2020); Cui P., Hu L., Liu Y., Enhancing extractive text summarization with topic-aware graph neural networks, Proc.

These studies often apply natural language processing (NLP) technologies due to the natural similarity between code and language. Since NLP usually consumes a lot of computing resources, its combination with quantum computing is becoming a valuable research direction. In this paper, we present a Recurrent Quantum Embedding Neural Network (RQENN) for vulnerability detection. It aims to reduce the memory consumption of classical models for vulnerability detection tasks and improve the performance of quantum natural language processing (QNLP) methods. We show that the performance of RQENN achieves the above goals. Compared with the classic model, the space complexity of each stage of its execution is exponentially reduced, and the number of parameters used and the number of bits consumed are significantly reduced. Compared with other QNLP methods, RQENN uses fewer qubit resources and achieves a 15.7% higher accuracy in vulnerability detection. © The Author(s) 2024.","","quantum dot; article; deep learning; diagnosis; female; human; natural language processing; nerve cell network; vulnerability","","","","","Major Science and Technology Projects in Anhui Province, (221100210600); Major Science and Technology Projects in Anhui Province","This study was funded by Major Science and Technology Projects in Henan Province, China (Grant No. 221100210600).

Chatbots, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), are increasingly prevalent across industries such as customer service, healthcare, e-commerce, and education. Despite their use and increasing complexity, chatbots are prone to errors like misunderstandings, inappropriate responses, and factual inaccuracies. These issues can have an impact on user satisfaction and trust. This research provides an overview of chatbots, conducts an analysis of errors they encounter, and examines different approaches to rectifying these errors. These approaches include using data-driven feedback loops, involving humans in the learning process, and adjusting through learning methods like reinforcement learning, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and meta-learning. Through real life examples and case studies in different fields, we explore how these strategies are implemented. Looking ahead, we explore the different challenges faced by AI-powered chatbots, including ethical considerations and biases during implementation. Furthermore, we explore the transformative potential of new technological advancements, such as explainable AI models, autonomous content generation algorithms (e.g., generative adversarial networks), and quantum computing to enhance chatbot training. Our research provides information for developers and researchers looking to improve chatbot capabilities, which can be applied in service and support industries to effectively address user requirements. © 2024 by the authors.","artificial intelligence (AI); chatbot training; conversational AI; error correction; natural language processing (NLP); reinforcement learning (RL)","","","","","","","","Gupta A., Hathwar D., Vijayakumar A., Introduction to AI chatbots, Int.

These characteristics make it particularly difficult for large models to effectively handle long Chinese texts using traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms. This paper explores the application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) as a solution to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in processing long Chinese texts. By leveraging the inherent advantages of QML, such as higher processing efficiency and deeper semantic understanding, this research demonstrates through experimental comparisons that QML models significantly outperform traditional ML models in both speed and comprehension accuracy. The paper systematically introduces text processing methods using both traditional ML and QML, and presents a simplified QML model designed to enhance text processing capabilities. The findings underscore the potential of QML in optimizing the future performance of LLMs, particularly for languages with complex linguistic structures like Chinese. This research holds significant implications for advancing LLM technologies in text-heavy applications.  © 2024 IEEE.","Large language models; long chinese texts; quantum machine learning; text processing capabilities","Contrastive Learning; Federated learning; Machine learning; Semantics; Chinese text; Language model; Large language model; Long chinese text; Machine-learning; Processing capability; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Text processing capability; Text-processing; Adversarial machine learning","","","","","","","Maria S., Sinayskiy I., Petruccione F., An introduction to quantum machine learning, Contemporary Physics, 56, pp. 172-185, (2015); Tariq M., Robles-Kelly A., Machine learning: Quantum vs classical, IEEE Access, pp. 219275-219294, (2020); Khadijeh N., Susanne F., Gao X., The development of quantum machine learning, Harvard Data Science Review, 4, (2022); Vedran D., Jacob M., Hans T.J., Quantum-enhanced machine learning, Physical review letters, 117, (2016); Zhao J.S., Research on Text Representation in Natural Language, Processing Journal of Software, 33, pp. 102-128, (2021); Xi X.F., Zhou G.D., Research on Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing, Journal of Automation, 42, pp. 1445-1465, (2016); Jeremy A., Advances in quantum machine learning; Danial I., Riaz A., HHL Algorithm for Linear Systems of Equations, (2023); Li H.N., COMMLU DATASET,"" Hugging face; Kao G., GAOKAO-Bench is an evaluation framework that utilizes GAOKAO questions as a dataset to evaluate large language models OpenLMLab; Cui R.X., AGIEval, GitHub; Su X.G., Xin Y., Chih-Ling T., Linear regression, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Statistic, 4, pp. 275-294, (2012); Wang J., Zhang R., Jiang N., A Review of Quantum Machine Learning, Journal of Software, pp. 1-35, (2024); Huang Y.M., Lei H., Li X.Y., Overview of Quantum Machine Learning Algorithms, Journal of Computer Science, 41, pp. 145-163, (2018)","T.

For the classification task, we utilized an amplitude encoding algorithm and achieved perfect accuracy on the standard lambeq dataset, which is commonly used for benchmarking in quantum NLP. Additionally, we obtained accuracy from 55% to 72.5 % on a more complex and realistic Amazon review dataset, which is still a reasonable result, given the current capability of quantum computing and QNLP. Additionally, we found that UMAP is the best dimension reduction method in our experiment setting. All classification results were done on the default. qubit simulator in pennylane 0.36 python library. Our classification results highlight the potential of quantum algorithms in practical applications. For the disambiguation task, we selected 18 ambiguous nouns, 32 unambiguous nouns, and 18 different verbs. Our experiments using the QASM simulator within the qiskit Python library demonstrated that the simulator could perfectly differentiate between the various meanings of ambiguous nouns in different contexts, achieving perfect differentiation. Furthermore, we extended our study to a real quantum device, the ibm-kyoto quantum computer. There, we tested our disambiguation approach on a subset of 4 random nouns (two ambiguous and two unambiguous) and observed that ibm-kyoto could achieve an accuracy range of 82.1 % to 98.9% in disambiguation tasks, extending the datasets and improving the results of existing ambiguity resolution experiments [1]. Our work demonstrates the capability of quantum computing in dealing with real-world NLP tasks, hence contributing to the advancement of both QML and NLP. © 2024 IEEE.","Natural Language Processing; Semantics; Sentiment Analysis; Supervised Machine Learning","Benchmarking; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Problem oriented languages; Python; Quantum electronics; Quantum entanglement; Self-supervised learning; Semi-supervised learning; Ambiguity resolution; Classification results; Classification tasks; Encoding algorithms; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Quantum Computing; Sentiment analysis; Supervised machine learning; Semantics","","","","","","","Widdows D., Alexander A., Zhu D., Zimmerman C., Majumder A., Near-Term Advances in Quantum Natural Language Processing, Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, (2024); Shor P.W., Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Prime Factorization and Discrete Logarithms on a Quantum Computer, SIAM Journal on Computing, 26, 5, pp. 1484-1509, (1997); Grover L.K., A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for database search, Proceedings of the Twenty-Eighth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, ser.

Through the application of Quantum-Accelerated Hyperparameter Tuning (QAHT), this abstract introduces a novel approach to addressing this issue. Our proposed framework leverages quantum computing capabilities to dynamically optimize NLP model hyperparameters in real-time, catering to the ever-changing character of textual data streams. Traditional hyperparameter optimisation methods usually rely on laborious grid searches or random exploration, which may not be suitable for dynamic NLP jobs. Contrarily, QAHT uses Quantum Neural Network (QNN) architectures that have been specially designed for hyperparameter optimisation. These QNNs improve performance and efficacy by dynamically modifying and improving model configurations. This abstract discusses the key elements of the QAHT architecture, including real-time model deployment, adaptive learning, and continuous data stream processing. In addition to speeding up the hyperparameter optimisation process, QAHT makes sure that NLP models are still flexible and responsive to shifts in the sentiment of the data and its distribution. This method has applications beyond NLP since it provides a foundation for effectively optimising machine learning models in complex, real-time situations. As quantum computing develops, QAHT represents a promising future in machine learning, where quantum-enhanced capabilities satisfy the needs of contemporary data-driven applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V..

Although some efforts based on syntactic analysis have opened the door to research in quantum NLP (QNLP), limitations such as heavy syntactic preprocessing and syntax-dependent network architecture make them impracticable on larger and real-world data sets. In this paper, we propose a new simple network architecture, called the quantum self-attention neural network (QSANN), which can compensate for these limitations. Specifically, we introduce the self-attention mechanism into quantum neural networks and then utilize a Gaussian projected quantum self-attention serving as a sensible quantum version of self-attention. As a result, QSANN is effective and scalable on larger data sets and has the desirable property of being implementable on near-term quantum devices. In particular, our QSANN outperforms the best existing QNLP model based on syntactic analysis as well as a simple classical self-attention neural network in numerical experiments of text classification tasks on public data sets. We further show that our method exhibits robustness to low-level quantum noises and showcases resilience to quantum neural network architectures. © Science China Press 2024.","natural language processing; parameterized quantum circuits; quantum neural networks; self-attention; text classification","Classification (of information); Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Quantum computers; Quantum noise; Syntactics; Text processing; Timing circuits; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Neural-networks; Parameterized; Parameterized quantum circuit; Quantum circuit; Quantum neural networks; Self-attention; Text classification; Network architecture","","","","","Chongqing University of Science and Technology, CQUST; Bureau of Education of Guangzhou Municipality; Quantum Science Center of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area; Chenghong ZHU; Guangdong Provincial Quantum Science Strategic Initiative, (GDZX2303007); Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0302901); China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201806070139); China Scholarship Council, CSC; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP180100691, G0101000151); Australian Research Council, ARC","This work was partially supported by Guangdong Provincial Quantum Science Strategic Initiative (Grant No. GDZX2303007).

However, these models need huge datasets for proper training and good generalization. This translates into high training and fine-tuning time, even several days for the most complex models and large datasets. In this work, we present a novel quantum Instance Selection (IS) approach that allows to significantly reduce the size of the training datasets (by up to 28%) while maintaining the model's effectiveness, thus promoting (training) speedups and scalability. Our solution is innovative in the sense that it exploits a different computing paradigm - Quantum Annealing (QA) - a specific Quantum Computing paradigm that can be used to tackle optimization problems. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no prior attempts to tackle the IS problem using QA. Furthermore, we propose a new Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation specific for the IS problem, which is a contribution in itself. Through an extensive set of experiments with several Text Classification benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate our quantum solution's feasibility and competitiveness with the current state-of-the-art IS solutions. © 2024 Owner/Author.","instance selection; quantum computing; text classification","Benchmarking; Deep learning; Photons; Quantum efficiency; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Complex task; Computing paradigm; Fine tuning; Generalisation; Instance selection; Instance selection problem; Learning approach; Quantum annealing; Quantum Computing; Text classification; Quantum computers","","","","","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais, FAPEMIG; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP; CINECA","We acknowledge the CINECA award under the ISCRA initiative, for the availability of high-performance computing resources and support.

However, in low-resource regions such as South Asia, where languages like Bengali are widely used, the research interest is relatively low compared to high-resource regions due to limited computational resources, flexible word order, and high inflectional nature of the language. With the development of quantum technology, quantum machine learning models leverage the superposition property of qubits to enhance model expressiveness and achieve faster computation compared to classical systems. To promote the development of quantum machine learning in low-resource language domains, we propose a quantum-classical hybrid architecture. This architecture utilizes a pretrained multilingual bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT) model to obtain vector representations of words and combines the proposed batch upload quantum recurrent neural network (BUQRNN) and parameter nonshared batch upload quantum recurrent neural network (PN-BUQRNN) as feature extraction models for sentiment analysis in Bengali. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed BUQRNN structure achieves a maximum accuracy improvement of 0.993% in Bengali text classification tasks while reducing average model complexity by 12%. The PN-BUQRNN structure surpasses the BUQRNN structure once again and outperforms classical architectures in certain tasks. © 2020 IEEE.","Natural language processing (NLP); quantum machine learning; quantum recurrent neural network","Classification (of information); Data mining; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network architecture; Sentiment analysis; Bengalis; Language processing; Low resource languages; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Neural networks structure; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum recurrent neural network; Recurrent neural networks","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62071240); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20231142); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0302901)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62071240, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province under Grant BK20231142, and in part by the Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology under Grant 2021ZD0302901.","Grefenstette J.J., Genetic algorithms and machine learning, Proc. 6th Annu.

This chapter explores how advancements in NLP, particularly through the deployment of large language models (LLMs), can be leveraged to enhance CTI in a quantum- aware context. It discusses the capabilities of NLP systems to process vast amounts of threat data, identify patterns, and predict potential risks while considering the implications of quantum technologies on cybersecurity frameworks. Furthermore, the chapter highlights the role of quantum- aware NLP tools in detecting advanced persistent threats, optimizing response strategies, and ensuring the resilience of digital ecosystems in the face of quantum- enabled cyber threats. By integrating LLMs with quantum computing principles, this research provides insights into the future of CTI and its evolution to counteract complex cyber challenges. © 2025 by IGI Global Scientific Publishing.

Guided by grammatical structure, words compose with each other to form sentences. Similarly, guided by discourse structure, sentences compose with each other to form dialogues and documents. Classical machine learning algorithms have achieved significant success in learning the meanings of words. When it comes to meanings of sentences and discourse units, they however fall short of being compositional. The DisCoCat model of meaning, introduced by Clark, Coecke, and Sadrzadeh in 2010, provides a solution—at the sentence level—using higher-order tensors, the learning of which has been a challenge. A recent initiative known as Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) introduces a translation between the DisCoCat tensors and Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC). This offers the potential of learning these higher-order tensors more efficiently when the circuits are executed on quantum computers. In previous work, we lifted the DisCoCat framework from the sentence level to the discourse level using a Fock space semantics. In this paper, we extend the DisCoCat-VQC translation to this semantics and experiment with it in a discourse task. We develop a massive dataset with 16,400 entries inspired by a major coreference resolution task, known as the Winograd Schema Challenge, proposed as a test of machine intelligence. Noisy and noiseless simulations were executed on IBMQ software, and the parameters of the discourse VQCs were learnt. The model converged to 77.5% accuracy, surpassing a Bag-of-Words model that neglects any structure. It also outperformed 2 out of 3 state-of-the-art classical coreference resolution architectures. These findings highlight the significant potential of quantum machine learning in advancing discourse analysis and structured natural language processing. © The Author(s) 2024.","Categorial grammars; Coreference resolution; Diagrammatic calculi; Fock spaces; Hybrid quantum-classical methods; Modal Lambek calculus; Quantum machine learning; Quantum natural language processing; Tensor space semantics; Variational quantum circuits","Context sensitive grammars; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Quantum electronics; Tensors; Variational techniques; Categorial grammar; Coreference resolution; Diagrammatic calculus; Fock spaces; Hybrid quantum-classical method; Lambek calculus; Language processing; Machine-learning; Modal lambek calculus; Natural languages; Quantum circuit; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum natural language processing; Quantum-classical methods; Space semantics; Tensor space semantic; Tensor spaces; Variational quantum circuit; Semantics","","","","","Royal Academy of Engineering, RAENG, (RCSRF2122-14-152); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/S021582/1)","Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh would like to express gratitude for the Royal Academy of Engineering Research Chair/Senior Research Fellowship RCSRF2122-14-152 on Engineered Mathematics for Modelling Typed Structures, which provided valuable funding for this research.

Since in 2003, Peter Shor complained about the limited increase in the number of QC algorithms [19], we see an urgent need to bridge the gap between well-established classical physics and quantum physics so that approaches become more intuitive, and - hopefully - more quantum algorithms can be discovered. In service-based hybrid QC frameworks, where algorithms need to be partitioned into quantum and classical tasks, we look at the methods available and the abstractions used. For this paper we have investigated the various levels of abstraction in Silq, Qrisp, OpenQl, Qiskit, Cirq, IonQ, and Ocean, which are originated in the QC domain, as well as CUDA Quantum, rooted in the classical software domain. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), we have also explored the capabilities of LLM-powered tools like GitHub Copilot, which currently represents the top level of abstraction. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Abstraction; Hybrid Systems; Quantum Computing; Software Engineering","Abstracting; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Software design; Abstraction; Abstraction level; Classical physics; Computing algorithms; Language model; Position papers; Programming framework; Programming software; Quantum Computing; Software development kit; Hybrid systems","","","","","Federal Ministry of the Republic of Austria","Funded by the Federal Ministry of the Republic of Austria, responsible for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology.","Bichsel B., Baader M., Gehr T., Vechev M., Silq: A high-level quantum language with safe uncomputation and intuitive semantics, Proceedings of the 41St ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation, Pp. 286–300.

However, implementing such complex tasks with LLMs poses a significant challenge, as classical computers may lack the necessary space to run or store the model parameters. In this context leveraging the principles of hybrid quantum machine learning for language models offers a promising solution to mitigate this issue by reducing storage space for model parameters. Although pure quantum language models have demonstrated success in recent past, they are constrained by limited features and availability. In this research we propose the DeepKet model an approach with a quantum embedding layer, which utilizes the Hilbert space generated by quantum entanglement to store feature vectors, leading to a significant reduction in size. The experimental analysis evaluates the performance of open-source pre-trained models like Microsoft Phi and CodeGen, specifically fine-tuned for generating Prolog code for geo-spatial data retrieval. Furthermore, it investigates the effectiveness of quantum DeepKet embedding layers by comparing them with the total parameter count of traditional models. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Generative AI; Large language model; Prolog; Quantum computing; Quantum machine learning; Transfer learning; Word2Vec","C (programming language); Embeddings; PROLOG (programming language); Quantum optics; Query languages; Structured Query Language; Transfer learning; Generative AI; Language model; Large language model; Machine-learning; Prolog; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Transfer learning; Word2vec; Quantum entanglement","","","","","","","Vaswani A., Shazeer N., Parmar N., Uszkoreit J., Jones L., Gomez A.N.L.I.:., Attention is all you need, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 30, (2017); Kim K., Ghatpande S., Kim D., Zhou X., Liu K., Bissyande T.F., Klein J., Le Traon Y., Big code search: a bibliography, ACM Comput.

Among the possibilities currently investigated, quantum transfer learning, i.e., using a quantum circuit for fine-tuning pre-trained classical models for a specific task, is attracting significant attention as a potential platform for proving quantum advantage. This work shows potential advantages, in terms of both performance and expressiveness, of quantum transfer learning algorithms trained on embedding vectors extracted from a large language model to perform classification on a classical linguistics task—acceptability judgements. Acceptability judgement is the ability to determine whether a sentence is considered natural and well-formed by a native speaker. The approach has been tested on sentences extracted from ItaCoLa, a corpus that collects Italian sentences labeled with their acceptability judgement. The evaluation phase shows results for the quantum transfer learning pipeline comparable to state-of-the-art classical transfer learning algorithms, proving current quantum computers’ capabilities to tackle NLP tasks for ready-to-use applications. Furthermore, a qualitative linguistic analysis, aided by explainable AI methods, reveals the capabilities of quantum transfer learning algorithms to correctly classify complex and more structured sentences, compared to their classical counterpart. This finding sets the ground for a quantifiable quantum advantage in NLP in the near future. © The Author(s) 2024.","Quantum machine learning; Quantum natural language processing; Variational quantum classifier","Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Learning systems; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Quantum circuit; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum natural language processing; Quantum-classical; Transfer learning; Variational quantum classifier; Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Abbas A., Sutter D., Zoufal C., Lucchi A., Figalli A., Woerner S., The power of quantum neural networks, Nat Comput Sci, 1, 6, pp. 403-409, (2021); Abbaszade M., Salari V., Mousavi S.S., Zomorodi M., Zhou X., Application of quantum natural language processing for language translation, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 130434-130448, (2021); Bates E., McNew S., MacWhinney B., Devescovi A., Smith S., Functional constraints on sentence processing: A cross-linguistic study, Cognition, 11, 3, pp. 245-299, (1982); Benedetti M., Lloyd E., Sack S., Fiorentini M., Parameterized quantum circuits as machine learning models, Quantum Sci Technol, 4, 4, (2019); Bergholm V., Izaac J., Schuld M., Gogolin C., Ahmed S., Ajith V., Sohaib Alam M., Alonso-Linaje G., Akashnarayanan B., Asadi A., Arrazola J.M., Azad U., Banning S., Blank C., Bromley T.R., Cordier B.A., Ceroni J., Delgado A., Di Matteo O., Dusko A., Garg T., Guala D., Hayes A., Hill R., Ijaz A., Isacsson T., Ittah D., Jahangiri S., Jain P., Jiang E., Khandelwal A., Kottmann K., Lang R.A., Lee C., Loke T., Lowe A., McKiernan K., Meyer J.J., Montanez-Barrera J.A., Moyard R., Niu Z., O'Riordan L.J., Oud S., Panigrahi A., Park C.Y., Polatajko D., Quesada N., Roberts C., Sa N., Schoch I., Shi B., Shu S., Sim S., Singh A., Strandberg I., Soni J., Szava A., Thabet S., Vargas-Hernandez R.A., Vincent T., Vitucci N., Weber M., Wierichs D., Wiersema R., Willmann M., Wong V., Zhang S., Killoran N., Pennylane: Automatic Differentiation of Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computations.

Variational quantum algorithms, especially those employing variational quantum circuits, have demonstrated notable advantages in domains including finance, chemistry, and machine learning. However, the practical deployment of these algorithms on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices faces challenges due to quantum noise, state collapse, and limited qubits numbers. The real-world performance of these algorithms remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing and implementing a novel method for training quantum self-attention model for text classification directly on quantum computing chips. This initiative marks the first instance of employing such models on actual quantum hardware. Our approach optimizes quantum circuit designs to mitigate the impact of quantum noise and introduces parallel training strategies to enhance efficiency. Our experiments, conducted on the 'Wukong' superconducting 72-qubit quantum computer, demonstrate that our models can be effectively trained on real quantum hardware. The results from the actual quantum chips slightly outperformed those from simulators, confirming the practical feasibility of applying quantum self-attention model to natural language processing tasks. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and provide valuable insights for the future deployment of quantum machine learning models.  © 2024 IEEE.","near-term quantum computer; quantum computing; quantum machine learning","Adversarial machine learning; Computer circuits; Integrated circuit design; Machine learning; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Quantum efficiency; Quantum electronics; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Variational techniques; Attention model; Computing paradigm; Development potential; Machine-learning; Near-term quantum computer; Quanta computers; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Qubits","","","","","","","Preskill J., Quantum computing 40 years later, Feynman Lectures on Computation, pp. 193-244, (2023); Egger D.J., Gambella C., Marecek J., McFaddin S., Mevissen M., Raymond R., Simonetto A., Woerner S., Yndurain E., Quantum computing for finance: State of the art and future prospects, IEEE Transactions on Quantum Engineering, 1, (2020); McArdle S., Endo S., Aspuru-Guzik A., Benjamin S.C., Yuan X., Quantum computational chemistry, Reviews of Modern Physics, 92, 1, (2020); Guerreschi G.G., Smelyanskiy V., Babbush R., McClean J., Optimization algorithms for quantum processors, Quantum Science and Technology, 8, 1, (2023); Schuld M., Petruccione F., Machine learning with quantum computers, Nature Reviews Physics, 4, 5, pp. 310-324, (2022); Huang H.-Y., Broughton M., Mohseni M., Babbush R., Boixo S., Neven H., McClean J.R., Power of data in quantum machine learning, Nature Communications, 12, 1, (2021); Preskill J., Quantum computing in the nisq era and beyond, Quantum, 2, (2018); Gambetta J., Chow J.M., Steffen M., Building logical qubits in a superconducting quantum computing system, npj Quantum Information, 3, 1, pp. 1-7, (2021); Bluvstein D., Demler E., Lukin M.D., A blueprint for demonstrating quantum supremacy with superconducting qubits, Science, 375, 6578, pp. 745-750, (2022); Cerezo M., Arrasmith A., Babbush R., Benjamin S.C., Endo S., Fujii K., McClean J.R., Mitarai K., Yuan X., Cincio L., Et al., Variational quantum algorithms, Nature Reviews Physics, 3, 9, pp. 625-644, (2021); Gentinetta G., Metz F., Carleo G., Overhead-constrained circuit knitting for variational quantum dynamics, Quantum, 8, (2024); McClean J.R., Romero J., Babbush R., Aspuru-Guzik A., The theory of variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, New Journal of Physics, 18, 2, (2016); Hidary J.D., Hidary J.D., Quantum computing: An applied approach, 1, (2019); LaRose R., Tikku A., O'Neel-Judy E., Cincio L., Coles P.J., Robust data encodings for quantum classifiers, Quantum Machine Intelligence, 2, 1, pp. 1-8, (2020); Schuld M., Sinayskiy I., Petruccione F., An introduction to quantum machine learning, Contemporary Physics, 56, 2, pp. 172-185, (2015); Nocedal J., Wright S.J., Numerical Optimization, Springer Science & Business Media, (2006); Vaswani A., Shazeer N., Parmar N., Uszkoreit J., Jones L., Gomez A.N., Kaiser L., Polosukhin I., Attention is all you need, Advances in neural information processing systems, 30, (2017); Lin Z., Feng M., Santos C.N.D., Yu M., Xiang B., Zhou B., Bengio Y., A structured self-attentive sentence embedding, (2017); Li G., Zhao X., Wang X., Quantum self-attention neural networks for text classification, Science China Information Sciences, 67, 4, (2024); Schuld M., Bergholm V., Gogolin C., Izaac J., Killoran N., Evaluating analytic gradients on quantum hardware, Physical Review A, 99, 3, (2019); Stokes J., Izaac J., Killoran N., Carleo G., Quantum natural gradient, Quantum, 4, (2020); Lorenz R., Pearson A., Meichanetzidis K., Kartsaklis D., Coecke B., Qnlp in practice: Running compositional models of meaning on a quantum computer, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 76, pp. 1305-1342, (2023)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Communications Society; University of Science and Technology of China","16th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing, WCSP 2024","24 October 2024 through 26 October 2024","Hefei","206065","","979-835039064-3","","","English","Int.

However, despite this active participation, text classification remains a crucial challenge due to the sheer volume of texts received from diverse sources and individuals with different mindsets. The shared opinions often prove to be incomplete, inconsistent, and noisy, further complicated by variations in languages. To address these challenges, NLP (Natural Language Processing) and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) methods have become widely employed. This study focuses on exploring the potential of current quantum computers in enhancing the performance of natural language processing tasks. Specifically, we propose a new approach called the Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) for sentiment analysis. Our proposed model is the first model based on QCNN at text classification field; it leverages QCNN to extract more effective features from short sentences; Thereby, improving sentiment analysis accuracy and efficiency. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Natural Language Processing; Quantum Convolutional Neural Network; Quantum Machine Learning; Sentiment Analysis","Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Machine learning; Quantum computers; Convolutional neural network; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Quantum convolutional neural network; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Sentiment analysis; Text classification; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Sharma A.K., Chaurasia S., Srivastava D.K., Sentimental short sentences classification by using CNN deep learning model with finetuned Word2Vec, Procedia Comput.

Here, we propose bridging this explanatory gap by drawing on concepts from topological quantum computing (TQC), specifically the anyonic frameworks arising from (Formula presented.) theories. Anyons interpolate between fermions and bosons, offering a mathematical language that may illuminate the latent structure and decision-making processes within LLMs. By examining how these topological constructs relate to token interactions and contextual dependencies in neural architectures, we aim to provide a fresh perspective on how meaning and coherence emerge. After eliciting insights from ChatGPT and exploring low-level cases of (Formula presented.) models, we argue that the machinery of modular tensor categories and topological phases could inform more transparent, stable, and robust AI systems. This interdisciplinary approach suggests that quantum-theoretic principles may underpin a novel understanding of explainable AI. © 2024 by the authors.","anyons; ChatGPT; large language models; SU(2)<sub>k</sub>; topology","","","","","","European Cooperation in Science and Technology, COST, (CA21169); European Cooperation in Science and Technology, COST","The first author would like to acknowledge the contribution of the COST Action CA21169, supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology).

Variational quantum circuits, where parameters of circuits are learned classically, have been widely used in many recent applications of QML. This is an instance of a hybrid quantum-classical framework, where both classical and quantum components are present. However, applying these techniques to applications involving massive data is a challenging task. One way to overcome this, is using the concept of classical-quantum transfer learning with the help of a dressed quantum circuit, introduced recently, where the underlying neural architecture is pre-trained classically, but at the final steps (decision layer), a quantum circuit is used, followed by quantum measurements and post-processing to classify images with high precision. In this paper, we applied hybrid classical-quantum transfer learning to another task of massive data processing, i.e., natural language processing (NLP). We show how to (binary) classify short texts (e.g., SMS) with classical-quantum transfer learning, which was originally applied to image processing only. Our quantum network uses pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers (BERT) model, and its variational quantum circuit is fine-tuned for text processing. We evaluated the performance of our hybrid neural architecture using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which is typically used in the evaluation of classification problems. The results indicate high precision as well as lower loss function. To our knowledge, our work is the first application of quantum transfer learning to the area of NLP. Finally, a comparison with a tool that uses learning but in a different way than transfer learning is presented. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Natural language processing; Quantum machine learning; Variational quantum computing","Classification (of information); Data handling; Image processing; Machine learning; Metadata; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Quantum computers; Text processing; Classical-quantum; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Transfer learning; Variational quantum computing; Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Abramsky S., Hardy L., Logical bell inequalities, Phys Rev A, 85, (2012); Adhikary S., Dangwal S., Bhowmik D., Supervised learning with a quantum classifier using multi-level systems, Quantum Inf Process, 19, 3, (2020); Azevedo V., Silva C., Dutra I., Quantum transfer learning for breast cancer detection, Quantum Mach Intell, 4, (2022); Benedetti M., Realpe-Gomez J., Perdomo-Ortiz A., Quantum-assisted Helmholtz machines: A quantum-classical deep learning framework for industrial datasets in near-term devices, Quantum Sci Technol, 3, 3, (2018); Bergholm V., Izaac J.A., Schuld M., Gogolin C., Killoran N., Pennylane: Automatic differentiation of hybrid quantum-classical computations, Arxiv, 1811, (2018); Georgiou G.M., Koutsougeras C., IEEE Trans Circuits Syst II: Analog Digit Signal Process, Complex Domain Backpropagation., 39, 5, pp. 330-334, (1992); Kartsaklis D., Fan I., Yeung R., Pearson A., Lorenz R., Toumi A., Felice G., Meichanetzidis K.S.B., ) lambeq: An efficient high-level Python library for quantum NLP, .

Thus, the detection of ADRs is crucial. This paper introduces a classical-quantum hybrid deep learning model for detecting adverse drug effects from social media reviews (in English). The suggested methodology improvises the ability to grasp human language for identifying pharmacological side effects of a drug. This article aims to combine the features of traditional machine learning methods to quantum computing into a single framework. The knowledge gained from the pre-trained classical model is transferred to quantum model, improving the performance of quantum algorithms. The Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) encodes, classical data and classifies input reviews into feature vectors. It creates a relationship network for each drug, based on condition and review comments, enabling class wise prediction to detect ADRs in a drug. The accuracy of quantum inspired transfer learning based proposed model architecture is quite encouraging and provides a good enough solution. In identifying ADRs from the study of reviews, this work obtained accuracy of 97% with a training loss of 0.0659 and validation loss of 0.072. A Bio-BERT based quantum transfer hybrid methodology is proposed for detecting adverse drug reactions from social media reviews. It provides more accurate prediction on ADRs of drug rather than earlier introduced methodologies. The proposed methodology emphasizes towards the quantum enhanced hybrid model design in research. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs); Bio-BERT; Natural Language Processing (NLP); Quantum Transfer Learning (QTL); Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC)","","","","","","","","Huang J.-Y., Lee W.-P., Lee K.-D., Predicting adverse drug reactions from social media posts: Data balance, feature selection and deep learning, Healthcare, 10, (2022); Odeh F., Taweel A., A deep learning approach to extracting adverse drug reactions, 2019 IEEE/ACS 16Th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA), pp. 1-6, (2019); Fox S., Et al., The social life of health information, 2011, (2011); Bouvy J.C., De Bruin M.L., Koopmanschap M.A., Epidemiology of adverse drug reactions in Europe: A review of recent observational studies, Drug Safety, 38, 5, pp. 437-453, (2015); Proposal for a regulation amending, as regards pharmacovigilance of medicinal products for human use, Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004.

Unlike traditional GEC tools, this system goes beyond simply correcting errors. It integrates ERRANT, a specialized tool that classifies the specific type of error present (e.g., subject-verb agreement, verb tense inconsistencies). This combined approach gives users a deeper understanding of their grammatical mistakes, fostering improved language proficiency, where evaluation metrics confirm significant advancements in GEC performance. The research delves further by exploring the potential of quantum natural language processing (QNLP). Quantum networking supports distributed, secure, real-time QNLP applications, leveraging quantum networks for complex language processing tasks. Together, they create context-aware, secure language processing tools, addressing human language complexities beyond classical computing's reach. This research enhances language proficiency and communication clarity by integrating T5 for GEC with insights on QNLP and quantum networking. © 2025 by IGI Global.

However, the essential prior knowledge and pretrained text features are often ignored at the early stage of the development of quantum-inspired models. To attacking the above challenges, a pretrained quantum-inspired deep neural network is proposed in this work, which is constructed based on quantum theory for carrying out strong performance and great interpretability in related NLP fields. Concretely, a quantum-inspired pretrained feature embedding (QPFE) method is first developed to model superposition states for words to embed more textual features. Then, a QPFE-ERNIE model is designed by merging the semantic features learned from the prevalent pretrained model ERNIE, which is verified with two NLP downstream tasks: 1) sentiment classification and 2) word sense disambiguation (WSD). In addition, schematic quantum circuit diagrams are provided, which has potential impetus for the future realization of quantum NLP with quantum device. Finally, the experiment results demonstrate QPFE-ERNIE is significantly better for sentiment classification than gated recurrent unit (GRU), BiLSTM, and TextCNN on five datasets in all metrics and achieves better results than ERNIE in accuracy, F1-score, and precision on two datasets (CR and SST), and it also has advantage for WSD over the classical models, including BERT (improves F1-score by 5.2 on average) and ERNIE (improves F1-score by 4.2 on average) and improves the F1-score by 8.7 on average compared with a previous quantum-inspired model QWSD. QPFE-ERNIE provides a novel pretrained quantum-inspired model for solving NLP problems, and it lays a foundation for exploring more quantum-inspired models in the future.  © 2024 The Authors.

While machine learning and deep learning methods are widely used for stock closing price prediction, these methods have some drawbacks, including high scalability, slow convergence, and poor generalization performance. Furthermore, because those models are inherently black-box, it is challenging to comprehend the logic underlying their forecasts. This study presents an explainable hybrid quantum neural network to investigate the influence of tweets on a stock price prediction. The datasets used in this analysis include the stock prices of six different organizations as well as the 4 million+ tweets written on X (previously Twitter). The proposed methodology finds the average sentiment score of daily tweets using a transformer model which is combined with historical stock data. The proposed hybrid genetic algorithm based quantum neural network predicts the future stock closing price more accurately and uses explainable artificial intelligence methods to investigate the influence of average sentiment score of tweets and compute each attribute contribution towards the outcome. The proposed hybrid quantum neural network outperforms the other existing classical machine learning and quantum inspired machine learning algorithms by achieving a model accuracy (R2) greater than 99% in the prediction of stock prices for the six different organizations. Further, based on the explainability analysis, we observe that the tweets do not influence stock price to a greater extent. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Explainable artificial intelligence; Genetic algorithm; Quantum neural networks; Sentiment analysis; Stock price prediction; Transformer model","Costs; Deep learning; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Sentiment analysis; Explainable artificial intelligence; Learning methods; Machine-learning; Price prediction; Quantum neural networks; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment scores; Stock price; Stock price prediction; Transformer modeling; Genetic algorithms","","","","","","","Liu G., Ma W., A quantum artificial neural network for stock closing price prediction, Inform Sci, 598, pp. 75-85, (2022); Yildirim D.C., Toroslu I.H., Fiore U., Forecasting directional movement of forex data using LSTM with technical and macroeconomic indicators, Financ Innov, 7, pp. 1-36, (2021); Wu D., Ma X., Olson D.L., Financial distress prediction using integrated Z-score and multilayer perceptron neural networks, Decis Support Syst, 159, (2022); Liu W., Yang Z., Cao Y., Huo J., Discovering the influences of the patent innovations on the stock market, Inf Process Manage, 59, 3, (2022); Yuan F., Zhan H., Stock market investment behavior based on behavioral finance based on data fusion algorithm, IETE J Res, pp. 1-7, (2022); Xu H., Cao D., Li S., A self-regulated generative adversarial network for stock price movement prediction based on the historical price and tweets, Knowl-Based Syst, 247, (2022); Ni H., Wang S., Cheng P., A hybrid approach for stock trend prediction based on tweets embedding and historical prices, World Wide Web, 24, pp. 849-868, (2021); Chiong R., Fan Z., Hu Z., Dhakal S., A novel ensemble learning approach for stock market prediction based on sentiment analysis and the sliding window method, IEEE Trans Comput Soc Syst, (2022); Chaudhari K., Thakkar A., Data fusion with factored quantization for stock trend prediction using neural networks, Inf Process Manage, 60, 3, (2023); Yan X., Yang H., Yu Z., Zhang S., Zheng X., Portfolio optimization: A return-on-equity network analysis, IEEE Trans Comput Soc Syst, (2023); Ma Y., Han R., Wang W., Portfolio optimization with return prediction using deep learning and machine learning, Expert Syst Appl, 165, (2021); Liu J., Lim K.H., Wood K.L., Huang W., Guo C., Huang H.-L., Hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural networks, Sci China Phys Mech Astron, 64, 9, (2021); Adadi A., Berrada M., Peeking inside the black-box: a survey on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), IEEE access, 6, pp. 52138-52160, (2018); Omrani N., Rivieccio G., Fiore U., Schiavone F., Agreda S.G., To trust or not to trust?

Given that the transformer, with self-attention as its core mechanism, has become a popular backbone model in the field of machine learning, the exploration of a quantum version of the self-attention mechanism has become an intriguing topic. In this paper, we propose a Quantum Self-Attention Model (QSAM) based on Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA), aiming to combine the advantages of quantum neural network and self-attention together. To implement the self-attention mechanism on quantum neural network, we employ parameterized quantum circuits to learn the features of input data in quantum-enhanced spaces, then introduce the innovative Amplitude-Phase Decomposition Measurement (APDM) to obtain the essential components of self-attention model: query, key and value. By introducing APDM, we can implement the quantum self-attention model with a lower parameter quantity than that of previous methods, making our QSAM have a better deployability on near-term quantum devices. We apply QSAM on both NLP and CV datasets for binary and multiple classification. The results show that our QSAM outperforms its classical counterpart and is as good as the state-of-the-art quantum self-attention model on NLP datasets. On CV datasets, our QSAM achieves better performance than other quantum image classifiers. These results demonstrate the powerful learning ability of our QSAM. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Data classification; Light-weight; Quantum machine learning; Quantum neural network; Self-attention","Classification (of information); Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Attention mechanisms; Attention model; Data classification; Light weight; Machine-learning; Phase decompositions; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum neural networks; Self-attention; Machine learning","","","","","Fundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ciências e da Tecnologia, FDCT; Macau, (0093/2022/A2, 0076/2022/A2, 0008/2022/AGJ); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2023YFB2703800); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","This work is supported by the Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR (0093/2022/A2, 0076/2022/A2, and 0008/2022/AGJ) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2023YFB2703800).

Traditional methods often grapple with the high-dimensional nature of textual data, leading to substantial computational demands. This study introduces a novel classical quantum k-nearest neighbors (CQKNN) algorithm, which integrates quantum circuits into a conventional machine-learning framework to enhance computational efficiency and reduce storage requirements. This hybrid approach uses a unified quantum circuit that simplifies multiple similarity calculations through mid-circuit measurements and qubit reset operations, significantly improving upon traditional multi-circuit quantum k-nearest neighbors (QKNN) models. The CQKNN algorithm, tested on datasets such as SMS Spam Collection, Twitter US Airline Sentiment, and IMDB Movie Reviews, not only outperforms classical KNN but also addresses challenges posed by noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices through advanced error mitigation techniques. This work highlights resource efficiency and reduced gate complexity and demonstrates the practical application of fidelity in quantum similarity calculations, setting new standards for quantum-enhanced machine learning and advancing current quantum technology capabilities in complex data classification tasks. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","hybrid classical quantum k-nearest neighbors; quantum computing; quantum machine learning; qubit reuse; text classification","Classification (of information); Computational efficiency; Digital storage; Learning algorithms; Motion compensation; Natural language processing systems; Nearest neighbor search; Quantum efficiency; Qubits; Text processing; Timing circuits; Classical-quantum; Hybrid classical quantum k-near neighbor; K Nearest Neighbor (k NN) algorithm; Machine-learning; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Qubit reuse; Reuse; Text classification; Machine learning","","","","","","","Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum computation and quantum information, (2010); Wiebe N., Kapoor A., Svore K., (2014); Ruan Y., Xue X., Liu H., Tan J., Li X., Int.

However, when viewing beam profiles from gratings using infrared (IR) cameras, it is often difficult to determine the corresponding heights where the beam profiles are located. In this work, we developed transformer models to recognize the corresponding height categories of beam profiles in light from SiPh gratings. The models are trained using two techniques: (1) input patches and (2) input sequence. For the model trained with input patches, the model achieved a recognition accuracy of 0.924. Meanwhile, the model trained with input sequence shows a lower accuracy of 0.892. However, when repeating the model training for 150 cycles, a model trained with input patches shows inconsistent accuracy ranges between 0.289 to 0.959, while the model trained with input sequence shows accuracy values between 0.75 to 0.947. The obtained outcomes can be expanded to various applications, including auto-focusing of light beams and auto-adjustment of the z-axis stage to acquire desired beam profiles. © 2024 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement.","","Photonic devices; Photonic integrated circuits; Photonic integration technology; Photons; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Trapped ions; quantum dot; silicon; Beam profiles; Computing community; Input sequence; Ion qubits; Ion traps; Optical addressing; Quantum Computing; Silicon photonics; Transformer modeling; Trapped ion; article; camera; female; grating; infrared radiation; photonics; surgery; Silicon photonics","","silicon, 7440-21-3","","","Singapore Police Force, SPF; Zolix Instrument Co.

This approach aims to advance semi-supervised learning in contexts characterized by limited labeled data by enabling more intricate and expressive embeddings that capture the underlying structure of the data effectively. Grounded in foundational quantum mechanics concepts such as superposition and entanglement, this approach redefines data representation by enabling more intricate and expressive embeddings. Emulating quantum superposition encodes each data point as a probabilistic amalgamation of multiple feature states, facilitating a richer, multidimensional representation of underlying structures and patterns. Additionally, quantum-inspired entanglement mechanisms are harnessed to model intricate dependencies between labeled and unlabeled data, promoting enhanced knowledge transfer and structural inference within the learning paradigm. In contrast to conventional quantum machine learning methodologies that often rely on quantum hardware, this framework is fully realizable within classical computational architectures, thus bypassing the practical limitations of quantum hardware. The versatility of this model is illustrated through its application to critical domains such as medical diagnosis, resource-constrained natural language processing, and financial forecasting—areas where data scarcity impedes the efficacy of traditional models. Experimental evaluations reveal that quantum-inspired embeddings substantially outperform standard approaches, enhancing model resilience and generalization in high-dimensional, low-sample scenarios. This research marks a significant stride in integrating quantum theoretical principles with classical machine learning, broadening the scope of data representation and semi-supervised learning while circumventing the technological barriers of quantum computing infrastructure. © 2024, Sakarya University.

To analyze attitudes and emotions in textual data, handling large datasets and significant computational power is essential. Traditional computing methods struggle with the growing data volume, prompting interest in quantum computing as a promising alternative with its inherent high-speed processing capacity. This study focuses on sentiment analysis applied to texts derived from bilateral conversation dialogues. The primary objective is to categorize emotions within the text as positive, neutral, or negative, while concurrently identifying the speaker. To achieve this, a novel quantum-classical hybrid approach is proposed. The quantum side of this approach includes the variational quantum circuit (VQC). On the classical side, preprocessing of the data set, feature extraction with a model containing LSTM, and optimizing the parameters of VQC are performed. The proposed approach was trained and tested using a data set containing bilateral conversations. As a result of the tests, the proposed approach achieved a higher accuracy rate compared to studies using the classical approach.

It examines various quantum-classical algorithms through extensive simulations on both classical and quantum hardware, utilizing key stock indicators like MACD, EMA, Bollinger Bands, and momentum metrics, alongside sentiment analysis of financial news. The dataset used includes real-time stock prices for 15 companies, focusing on Merck & Co. (MRK). By framing stock price forecasting as a binary classification problem, It proposes QLSTM4FM i.e. a unique framework based on quantum-assisted LSTM model, which significantly enhances stock price forecasting. It conducts a thorough and comprehensive performance evaluation of the proposed framework against classical LSTM models. Results show that QLSTM4FM, featuring quantum-enhanced layers, outperforms classical LSTM models in accuracy, lower loss, and faster convergence, demonstrating the potential of quantum computing in financial forecasting.  © 2024 IEEE.","QLSTM; Quantum Finance; Sentiment Analysis; Variational Quantum Layers (VQLs)","Financial markets; Long short-term memory; Multilayer neural networks; Quantum efficiency; Quantum electronics; Variational techniques; Hybrid neural networks; Market trends; Neural network architecture; QLSTM; Quantum finances; Sentiment analysis; Short term memory; Stock price forecasting; Trend forecasting; Variational quantum layer; Costs","","","","","","","Elzerman J.M., Et al., Semiconductor few-electron quantum dots as spin qubits, Quantum dots: A doorway to nanoscale physics, pp. 25-95, (2005); Adcock J., Allen E., Day M., Frick S., Hinchliff J., Johnson M., Morley-Short S., Pallister S., Price A., Stanisic S., Advances in quantum machine learning, (2015); Lloyd S., Mohseni M., Rebentrost P., Quantum algorithms for supervised and unsupervised machine learning, (2013); Lloyd S., Mohseni M., Rebentrost P., Quantum principal compo-nent analysis, Nature Physics, 10, 9, pp. 631-633, (2014); Rebentrost P., Mohseni M., Lloyd S., Quantum support vector machine for big data classification, Physical Review Letters, 113, 13, (2014); Wiebe N., Kapoor A., Svore K.M., Quantum deep learning, (2014); Emmanoulopoulos D., Dimoska S., Quantum machine learning in finance: Time series forecasting, (2022); Liu G., Ma W., A quantum artificial neural network for stock closing price prediction, Information Sciences, 598, pp. 75-85, (2022); Naik A., Yeniaras E., Hellstern G., Prasad G., Prasad Vishwakarma S.K.L., From portfolio optimization to quantum blockchain and security: A systematic review of quantum computing in finance, (2023); Rebentrost P., Lloyd S., Quantum computational finance: quantum algorithm for portfolio optimization, (2018); Huggins W., Patil P., Mitchell B., Whaley K.B., Stoudenmire E.M., Towards quantum machine learning with tensor networks, Quantum Science and Technology, 4, 2, (2019); Cerezo M., Arrasmith A., Babbush R., Benjamin S.C., Endo S., Fujii K., McClean J.R., Mitarai K., Yuan X., Cincio L., Et al., Varia-tional quantum algorithms, Nature Reviews Physics, 3, 9, pp. 625-644, (2021); Schuld M., Sinayskiy I., Petruccione F., The quest for a quan-tum neural network, Quantum Information Processing, 13, pp. 2567-2586, (2014); Jia Z., Yi B., Zhai R., Wu Y.-C., Guo G.-C., Guo G.-P., Quantum neural network states: A brief review of methods and applications, Advanced Quantum Technologies, 2, 7-8, (2019); Situ H., He Z., Wang Y., Li L., Zheng S., Quantum generative adversarial network for generating discrete distribution, Information Sciences, 538, pp. 193-208, (2020); Chen S.Y.-C., Yoo S., Fang Y.-L., Quantum long short-term memory, ICASSP 2022-2022 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 8622-8626, (2022); Abbas A., Sutter D., Zoufal C., Lucchi A., Figalli A., Woerner S., The power of quantum neural networks, Nature Computational Sci-ence, 1, 6, pp. 403-409, (2021); Takaki Y., Mitarai K., Negoro M., Fujii K., Kitagawa M., Learning temporal data with a variational quantum recurrent neural network, Physical Review A, 103, 5, (2021); Paquet E., Soleymani F., Quantumleap: Hybrid quantum neural network for financial predictions, Expert Systems with Applications, 195, (2022)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Axis Bank; et al.; ICICI Bank; idco, Odisha; Karnataka Bank; Oasys","2024 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Sustainable Innovations in Technology, IC-SIT 2024","21 November 2024 through 23 November 2024","Hybrid, Bhubaneswar","206612","","979-835036917-5","","","English","Int.

One of the most evolving but, due to the computation power of standard computers, reasonably limited application domain is natural language processing (NLP). NLP seeks to give interactive systems the ability to understand and manipulate human language. Making systems understand and manipulate human languages requires large amounts of data and computational power during learning as well as during the execution of NLP. For handling these amounts of data like text and audio recordings and the complexity of classical NLP algorithms, quantum computation has emerged as a promising solution. This work gives an extensive overview of this new field, known as quantum natural language processing (QNLP). Introducing the basics of quantum computing, we discuss its use in NLP by explaining the different proposed embedding models, quantum algorithms, and other methods of QNLP. As QNLP is still in its infancy, this comprehensive overview is the foundation that points to the upcoming research direction.  © 2013 IEEE.","Natural language processing (NLP); quantum algorithms; quantum computing; quantum gates; qubits","Natural language processing systems; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Computational power; Human language; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; New dimensions; Quanta computers; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum gates; Quantum computers","","","","","","","Orrell D., Quantum Economics and Finance, (2022); Widdows D., A mathematical model for context and word-meaning, Proc. 4th Int.

The beam waists data at various heights above the grating is first compiled. Then, we used a sequence of the current beam waist values, z-positions, and the computed mathematical indicators (features) to predict the next beam waist value (labels). Optimized transformer model yields average percentage error (APE) of 6.6% between the predicted and actual beam waists, which corresponds to 93.4% prediction accuracy. This study provides a pioneering approach to using natural language processing model to perform predictive modelling on photonics data, and possible extrapolation of photonics data using transformer model.  © 2009-2012 IEEE.","Attention; gratings; multi-head attention; photonics integrated circuits; quantum computing; self-attention; silicon photonics; transformer model","Hadrons; Laser beams; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Photonic devices; Photonic integrated circuits; Photonic integration technology; Photons; Prediction models; Quantum electronics; Steganography; Attention; Computational modelling; Grating; Multi-head attention; Photonics Integrated Circuits; Predictive models; Quantum Computing; Self-attention; Silicon photonics; Transformer; Transformer modeling; Silicon photonics","","","","","Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE, (T2EP50121-0002, MOE-000180-01, RG135/23, RT3/23)","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of Singapore AcRF Tier 2 (T2EP50121-0002 (MOE-000180-01)) and AcRF Tier 1 (RG135/23, RT3/23).

Systems under test (SUTs) that take in programming or formal language as inputs, e.g., compilers, runtime engines, constraint solvers, and software libraries with accessible APIs, are especially important as they are fundamental building blocks of software development. However, existing fuzzers for such systems often target a specific language, and thus cannot be easily applied to other languages or even other versions of the same language. Moreover, the inputs generated by existing fuzzers are often limited to specific features of the input language, and thus can hardly reveal bugs related to other or new features. This paper presents Fuzz4ALL, the first fuzzer that is universal in the sense that it can target many different input languages and many different features of these languages. The key idea behind Fuzz4ALL is to leverage large language models (LLMs) as an input generation and mutation engine, which enables the approach to produce diverse and realistic inputs for any practically relevant language. To realize this potential, we present a novel autoprompting technique, which creates LLM prompts that are well- suited for fuzzing, and a novel LLM-powered fuzzing loop, which iteratively updates the prompt to create new fuzzing inputs. We evaluate Fuzz4ALL on nine systems under test that take in six different languages (C, C++, Go, SMT2, Java, and Python) as inputs. The evaluation shows, across all six languages, that universal fuzzing achieves higher coverage than existing, language-specific fuzzers. Furthermore, Fuzz4ALL has identified 98 bugs in widely used systems, such as GCC, Clang, Z3, CVC5, OpenJDK, and the Qiskit quantum computing platform, with 64 bugs already confirmed by developers as previously unknown.  © 2024 ACM.","fuzzing; large language models; software engineering","C++ (programming language); Iterative methods; Program compilers; Program debugging; Python; Quantum computers; Software design; Software testing; Constraint solvers; Fundamental building blocks; Fuzzing; Language model; Large language model; Runtimes; Software libraries; Software-systems; Specific languages; Systems under tests; Engines","","","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG; Kwai Inc.; National Science Foundation, NSF, (CCF-2131943, CCF-2141474); National Science Foundation, NSF; European Research Council, ERC, (851895); European Research Council, ERC","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (grants CCF-2131943 and CCF-2141474), Kwai Inc., the European Research Council (ERC, grant agreement 851895), and the German Research Foundation within the ConcSys and DeMoCo projects.","Qiskit/Qiskit, (2021); std: expected, (2023); Aschermann C., Frassetto T., Holz T., Jauernig P., Sadeghi A., Teuchert D., NAUTILUS: Fishing for Deep Bugs with Grammars, NDSS, (2019); Bang Y., Cahyawijaya S., Lee N., Dai W., Su D., Wilie B., Lovenia H., Ji Z., Yu T., Chung W., Et al., A multitask, multilingual, multimodal evaluation of chatgpt on reasoning, hallucination, and interactivity, (2023); Bareiss P., Souza B., D'Amorim M., Pradel M., Code Generation Tools (Almost) for Free? a Study of Few-Shot, Pre-Trained Language Models on Code, (2022); Bohme M., Cadar C., Roychoudhury A., Fuzzing: Challenges and reflections, IEEE Software, 38, 3, pp. 79-86, (2020); Bohme M., Szekeres L., Metzman J., On the reliability of coverage-based fuzzer benchmarking, Proceedings of the 44th International Conference on Software Engineering, pp. 1621-1633, (2022); Brown T.B., Mann B., Ryder N., Subbiah M., Kaplan J., Dhariwal P., Neelakantan A., Shyam P., Sastry G., Askell A., Agarwal S., Herbert-Voss A., Krueger G., Henighan T., Child R., Ramesh A., Ziegler D.M., Wu J., Winter C., Hesse C., Chen M., Sigler E., Litwin M., Gray S., Chess B., Clark J., Berner C., McCandlish S., Radford A., Sutskever I., Amodei D., Language Models are Few-Shot Learners, (2020); Bubeck S., Chandrasekaran V., Eldan R., Gehrke J., Horvitz E., Kamar E., Lee P., Tat Lee Y., Li Y., Lundberg S., Et al., Sparks of artificial general intelligence: Early experiments with gpt-4, (2023); Bulekov A., Das B., Hajnoczi S., Egele M., No Grammar.

Understanding quantum algorithms requires knowledge of physics and mathematics, which can be challenging for software developers. Aims: In this work, we provide a first analysis of how LLMs can support developers' understanding of quantum code. Method: We empirically analyse and compare the quality of explanations provided by three widely adopted LLMs (Gpt3.5, Llama2, and Tinyllama) using two different human-written prompt styles for seven state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. We also analyse how consistent LLM explanations are over multiple rounds and how LLMs can improve existing descriptions of quantum algorithms. Results: Llama2 provides the highest quality explanations from scratch, while Gpt3.5 emerged as the LLM best suited to improve existing explanations. In addition, we show that adding a small amount of context to the prompt significantly improves the quality of explanations. Finally, we observe how explanations are qualitatively and syntactically consistent over multiple rounds. Conclusions: This work highlights promising results, and opens challenges for future research in the field of LLMs for quantum code explanation. Future work includes refining the methods through prompt optimisation and parsing of quantum code explanations, as well as carrying out a systematic assessment of the quality of explanations.  © 2024 Owner/Author.","Code Explainability; Large Language Models; Quantum Computing","Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Code explainability; Design and implementations; Language model; Large language model; Programming paradigms; Quantum algorithms; Quantum codes; Quantum Computing; Software developer; State of the art","","","","","National Recovery and Resilience Plan; UCL-CS; European Commission, EC; Innovate UK; PNRR; RI for Social Mining and Big Data Analytics, (IR0000013, 3264); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/Y005244/1, EP/W032635/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT, (2023.02439); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT; European Research Council, ERC, (741278); European Research Council, ERC","G. d'Aloisio is partially funded by the European Union - NextGenerationEU - National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR) - Project: \""SoBigData.it - Strengthening the Italian RI for Social Mining and Big Data Analytics\"" - Prot.

Therefore, there is hope for future progress in NLP efforts that use quantum technology, especially in emotion classification. In this study, we use quantum computing models to delve deeply into two sentiment categorization approaches. To be more specific, the effectiveness of the models is evaluated by looking at VQC and QSVM.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) stands out as a pivotal tool, particularly in analyzing vast troves of unstructured data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The application of Transformer-based NLP models, such as BERT and GPT, in extracting Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) information from EHRs to offer insight into factors that extend beyond clinical indicators to influence patient health. Despite the significance of SDOH in healthcare, their extraction from EHRs remains underexplored. This study aims to demonstrate the efficacy of quantum computing-based NLP in identifying and categorizing SDOH information.

The field that has, to date, yielded more quantum-based attention is the retrieval and classification of textual data. This work aims to replicate the excellent results of hybrid quantum approaches for syntactic tasks on semantic classification tasks. In detail, a quantum machine learning algorithm, namely, the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), is used to perform sentiment analysis classification tasks. This algorithm can deduce the relationships between input features and their corresponding class affiliations using a parametrized quantum circuit and an encoding layer that translates classical data into quantum states. The approach has been tested on a well-known benchmark annotated dataset used for the Italian language, and the results have been compared to existing baselines, pointing out state-of-the-art scores. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","QNLP;

The distributional compositional categorical (DisCoCat) model is a framework that can both capture the distributional information of words and the syntactic structure of sentence. Thus, we research the application of DisCoCat models in both quantum and classical natural language processing. Specifically, in classical and quantum natural language processing, we respectively converted sentences into tensor networks and quantum circuits based on the DisCoCat model to get representation containing both semantic and syntactic information of language in classical and quantum computer. We conduct experiment for a text binary classification task in both classical and quantum natural language processing setting to verify the effectiveness of DisCoCat model. The experimental results shown that the combination of DisCoCat with quantum computing has significant potential. © 2024 IEEE.","DisCoCat; QNLP; text representation","Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Quantum electronics; Semantics; Syntactics; Tensors; Categorical model; Distributional compositional categorical; Language model; Language processing; Learning patterns; Model-based OPC; Natural languages; Neural-networks; QNLP; Text representation; Quantum computers","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62201525, 61972050); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (CUC24QT08)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62201525, 61972050), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (CUC24QT08).","Lipton Z.C., Berkowitz J., Elkan C., A critica l re- view of recurrent neura l networks for sequence lea rning, (2015); Li Z., Liu F., Yang W., Peng S., Zhou J., A survey of convolutional neura l networks: A na lysis, a pplica tions, a nd prospects, IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems, 33, 12, pp. 6999-7019, (2021); Vaswani A., Shazeer N., Parmar N., Uszkoreit J., Jones L., Gomez A.N., Kaiser L., Polosukhin I., Attention is a ll you need, Advances in neural information processing systems, 30, (2017); Coecke B., Sadrzadeh M., Clark S., Ma thematica l foundations for a compositional distributional model of mea ning, (2010); Rieser H.-M., Koster F., Raulf A.P., Tensor networks or qua ntum ma chine lea rning, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, 479, 2275, (2023); Coecke B., De Felice G., Meichanetzidis K., Toumi A., Founda tions for near-term qua ntum na tura l la ngua ge processing, (2020); Mikolov T., Chen K., Corrado G., Dean J., Efficient estima tion of word representa tions in vector spa ce, (2013); Pennington J., Socher R., Manning C.D., Glove: Globa l vectors for word representa tion, Proceedings of the 2014 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing (EMNLP, 2014, pp. 1532-1543; Peters M.E., Neumann M., Iyyer M., Gardner M., Clark C., Lee K., Zettlemoyer L., Deep contextua lized word representa tions, Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, 1, pp. 2227-2237, (2018); Kenton J.D.M.-W.C., Touta Nova L.K., Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectiona l tra nsformers for la ngua ge understa nding, Proceedings of NAACL-HLT, pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Arora S., Liang Y., Ma T., A simple but tough -to- beat baseline for sentence embeddings, International conference on learning representations, 2016, pp. 1367-1377, (2017); Hill F., Cho K., Korhonen A., Learning distributed representations of sentences from unlabeled da ta, 15th Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, NAACL HLT, pp. 1367-1377, (2016); Kiros J., Chan W., InferLite: Simple universal sentence representa tions from na tura l la ngua ge inference da ta, Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2018, pp. 4868-4874; Lorenz R., Pearson A., Meichanetzidis K., Kartsaklis D., Coecke B., Qnlp in pra ctice: Running compositiona l models of mea ning on a qua ntum computer, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 76, pp. 1305-1342, (2023); Sordoni A., Nie J.-Y., Bengio Y., Modeling term dependencies with quantum language models for IR, Proceedings of the 36th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval, pp. 653-662, (2013)","T.

This paper explores the integration of quantum computing and natural language processing (NLP) to enhance cyber threat analysis. Traditional computing methods struggle to keep up with the scale and complexity of modern cyber threats, but quantum computing offers a promising avenue for accelerated data processing, while NLP provides sophisticated tools for interpreting and understanding human language, crucial for analysing threat intelligence. Our proposed framework leverages quantum algorithms for rapid anomaly detection and advanced NLP techniques for precise threat identification and analysis. The methodology includes data collection from diverse sources, pre-processing for normalization, quantum-assisted data processing using Grover's search and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), NLP analysis with transformers and BERT-based models, and integration of findings to build comprehensive threat profiles. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements: quantum algorithms reduced data processing time by up to 50%, NLP models achieved 92% accuracy in threat identification, and the false positive rate was reduced by 30%. These findings indicate a promising direction for next-generation cybersecurity solutions, enabling more proactive and efficient threat mitigation. Future work will focus on refining quantum algorithms, enhancing NLP models, and expanding the framework for real-time threat detection capabilities. © 2024, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG).

Mostly, many organizations are using the major advanced features of quantum computing technologies and hence there is some need in analyzing the features and implication strategies of Quantum computing. In this chapter, an advanced version of the H-Bert Classifier is applied to the Quantum framework for finding the various problems related to the heart. Normally 14 important variables are used from the dataset for determining the heart valves. H-Bert classifier is used here for improving the accuracy rate of classification. To maintain maximum accuracy some of the quantum computing algorithms like Quantum Logistic Regression (QLR), Quantum Nearest Neighbor (QKNN), and Quantum Linear Discriminant Analysis (QLDA) are used. The most complicated patterns in the dataset are determined effectively by using the Quantum computation mechanism with the H-Bert classifier. To normalize the obtained values while processing some advanced methods like principal component analysis (PCA), min-max scaling, and standard scalar methods, are used. H-Bert combines BERT classifier in addition to Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (BiLSTM). Then for making the detection process very accurate and sensitive minor details of the heart valve are to be picked out. The H-Bert Classifier with Quantum ensemble will do the process effectively and accurately. The entire implementation process is a sequential, step-by-step procedure. This pipeline process will make the scheme more efficient and performance-driven. Compared to the traditional machine learning algorithms the detection of heart valves is done most effectively by using this quantum algorithm. The improvement in the accuracy is guaranteed by the quantum algorithms in the determination of heart health diagnostics. Another advantage of using this hybrid methodology is its effectiveness in handling the computational cost. Especially in dealing with real-time parameters, it took very less time during execution. The study sheds light on the best ways to use quantum algorithms in healthcare and gives useful insights into the quantifiable benefits of using quantum machine learning for detecting heart valves. A major step forward in the efficient and accurate diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities has been the introduction of the H-Bert classifier in quantum machine learning. Both medical research and patient care stand to benefit substantially from this new development. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology and its licensors 2024.","H-Bert classifier; K-nearest neighbors;

This argument is, in essence, an extension of the Augustinian argument - the baseline argument from mathematics and abstract objects - for the existence of God that accounts for contemporary advances in QM.

We focus on the recently proposed DisCoCirc framework for natural language, and propose a quantum adaptation, QDisCoCirc. This is motivated by a compositional approach to rendering AI interpretable: the behavior of the whole can be understood in terms of the behavior of parts, and the way they are put together. For the model-native primitive operation of text similarity, we derive quantum algorithms for fault-tolerant quantum computers to solve the task of question-answering within QDisCoCirc, and show that this is BQP-hard; note that we do not consider the complexity of question-answering in other natural language processing models. Assuming widely-held conjectures, implementing the proposed model classically would require super-polynomial resources. Therefore, it could provide a meaningful demonstration of the power of practical quantum processors. The model construction builds on previous work in compositional quantum natural language processing. Word embeddings are encoded as parameterized quantum circuits, and compositionality here means that the quantum circuits compose according to the linguistic structure of the text. We outline a method for evaluating the model on near-term quantum processors, and elsewhere we report on a recent implementation of this on quantum hardware. In addition, we adapt a quantum algorithm for the closest vector problem to obtain a Grover-like speedup in the fault-tolerant regime for our model. This provides an unconditional quadratic speedup over any classical algorithm in certain circumstances, which we will verify empirically in future work. © T. Laakkonen, K. Meichanetzidis, B.

This proposed model enhanced the human language understanding for detecting adverse reactions of drug. Quantum transformers are used for position embedding and attention purpose. Variational quantum circuit encoded the human language and identify the relevant components of the input reviews as class feature vectors to develop a relationship network for each drug correspond to the condition and review comments on which probability distribution functions applied to detect ADRs found in a medicinal product or not. The correctness of advanced model architecture built on quantum transformer is quite encouraging, and it performs better than other cutting-edge learning models. Achieved an accuracy of 93% with a loss of 0.0393 with this proposed model. Though it is too early to declare that quantum computing has completely replaced.

In turn, this poses a threat to bibliometrics-based technology monitoring and forecasting in rapidly moving fields. We propose to address this issue by leveraging semantic entity triplets. Specifically, we extract factual statements from scientific papers and represent them as (subject, predicate, object) triplets before validating the factual consistency of statements within and between scientific papers. This approach heavily penalizes blind usage of stochastic text generators such as LLMs while not penalizing authors who used LLMs solely to improve the readability of their paper. Here, we present a pipeline to extract such triplets and compare them. While our pipeline is promising and sensitive enough to detect inconsistencies between papers from different domains, the intra-paper entity reference resolution needs to be improved to ensure that triplets are more specific. We believe that our pipeline will be useful to the general research community working on the factual consistency of scientific texts. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Bibliometrics; Entity Extraction; Machine Learning; Quantum Computing; Technological Forecasting","Consistency; Generators; Monitoring; Paper Mills; Power; Resolution; Technology; Utilization; Bibliographic retrieval systems; Modeling languages; Quantum computers; Semantics; Stochastic models; Academic paper; Bibliometric; Entity extractions; Language model; Machine-learning; Paper mill; Power; Quantum Computing; Scientific papers; Technology monitoring; Stochastic systems","","","","","","","Zhang Y., Porter A.

However, the training of DL models requires huge datasets and long training times. We introduce a novel quantum Instance Selection (IS) approach that reduces training dataset sizes by up to 28% while maintaining effectiveness, enhancing training efficiency and scalability. Our method leverages Quantum Annealing (QA), a specific Quantum Computing paradigm, that can address optimization problems. This is the first attempt to tackle the IS problem using QA, and we propose a new Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation for it. Extensive experiments with several Automatic Text Classification (ATC) datasets show our solution’s feasibility and competitiveness with current state-of-the-art IS solutions. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Deep Learning; Instance Selection; Quantum Annealing; Transformer","Contrastive Learning; Deep learning; Large datasets; Quantum efficiency; Complex task; Data set size; Deep learning; Fine tuning; Instance selection; Learning models; Quantum annealing; Training dataset; Training time; Transformer; Quantum computers","","","","","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais, FAPEMIG; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP; CINECA","We acknowledge the CINECA award under the ISCRA initiative, for the availability of high-performance computing resources and support.

By harnessing the power of quantum mechanics, quantum computers are expected to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers, particularly in areas such as encryption and data security. This chapter explores the fundamental principles of quantum computing and its potential implications for cybersecurity. We discuss the challenges posed by quantum algorithms, including Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm, which can break widely- used cryptographic systems like RSA and AES. Furthermore, we examine the transition towards quantum- resistant algorithms, also known as post- quantum cryptography (PQC), and the role of large language models (LLMs) in facilitating the adaptation of cybersecurity strategies to a quantum- enabled future. The chapter concludes with a look at the future of quantum- aware cybersecurity, emphasizing the need for robust, adaptable frameworks to address emerging threats. © 2025 by IGI Global Scientific Publishing.

The insufficiency of classic phishing detection tools has become apparent as fraudsters continue to develop new strategies; these approaches mostly depend on variables such as URL character sequences, site content, and visual resemblance. The present study highlights the ""Zérosdetect"" approach, a quantum-powered technique for detecting phishing URLs using zero-shot learning, a robust model that makes use of both the zero-shot learning's adaptability and the computational advantageous nature of quantum computing, it mitigates the need for extensive previous knowledge of phishing URL attributes. In order to detect previously undiscovered phishing attacks, quantum neural network have been deployed to convert URL data into quantum spaces, therefore using the computational benefits of quantum systems. Quantum layers embedded inside Qnodes are a key part of the present system, calculating gradients at a faster pace, optimizing the network performance by rapidly calculating gradients, making the solution both efficient and forward-thinking. The present study lays the groundwork for future cybersecurity initiatives in the era of quantum computing, enhancing the potential to predict new cases of phishing. © 2023 IEEE.","Cybersecurity frameworks; Natural Language Processing; Quantum Computing; Quantum Language Models; Zero-Shot Learning","Computer crime; Data handling; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Zero-shot learning; Confidential information; Cyber security; Cybersecurity framework; Language model; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Phishing; Quantum Computing; Quantum language model; Learning systems","","","","","","","Vedral V., Introduction to Quantum Information Science, (2006); Horodecki R., Horodecki P., Horodecki M., Horodecki K., Quantum entanglement, Reviews of Modern Physics, 81, 2, pp. 865-942, (2009); Shor P.W., Algorithms for quantum computation: discrete logarithms and factoring, Proceedings 35th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science; Grover L.K., A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for database search, Proceedings of the twenty-eighth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing - STOC'96, (1996); Biamonte J., Wittek P., Pancotti N., Rebentrost P., Wiebe N., Lloyd S., Quantum machine learning, Nature, 549, 7671, pp. 195-202, (2017); Schuld M., Sinayskiy I., Petruccione F., An introduction to quantum machine learning, Contemporary Physics, 56, 2, pp. 172-185, (2014); Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (2012); Chen Y., Pan Y., Dong D., Quantum Language Model With Entanglement Embedding for Question Answering, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 53, 6, pp. 3467-3478, (2023); Li Q., Uprety S., Wang B., Song D., Quantum-Inspired Complex Word Embedding, Proceedings of The Third Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP, (2018); Kumar Y., Verma S.K., Sharma S., Quantum-inspired binary gravitational search algorithm to recognize the facial expressions, International Journal of Modern Physics C, 31, 10, (2020); Lai W., Shi J., Chang Y., Quantum-Inspired Fully Complex-Valued Neutral Network for Sentiment Analysis, Axioms, 12, 3, (2023); Xian Y., Lampert C.H., Schiele B., Akata Z., Zero-Shot Learning-A Comprehensive Evaluation of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 41, 9, pp. 2251-2265, (2019); Somesha M., Pais A.R., Rao R.S., Rathour V.S., Efficient deep learning techniques for the detection of phishing websites, Sādhanā, 45, 1, (2020); Aljofey A., Et al., An effective detection approach for phishing websites using URL and HTML features, Scientific Reports, 12, 1, (2022); Sarhan M., Layeghy S., Gallagher M., Portmann M., From zero-shot machine learning to zero-day attack detection, International Journal of Information Security, 22, 4, pp. 947-959, (2023); Wang W., Zheng V.W., Yu H., Miao C., A Survey of Zero-Shot Learning, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 10, 2, pp. 1-37, (2019); Di Pierro A., Incudini M., Quantum Machine Learning and Fraud Detection, Protocols, Strands, and Logic, pp. 139-155, (2021); Aldakheel E.A., Zakariah M., Gashgari G.A., Almarshad F.A., Alzahrani A.I.A., A Deep Learning-Based Innovative Technique for Phishing Detection in Modern Security with Uniform Resource Locators, Sensors, 23, 9, (2023); Boneh D., Zhandry M., Quantum-Secure Message Authentication Codes, Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2013, pp. 592-608, (2013); Dunjko V., Taylor J.M., Briegel H.J., Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning, Physical Review Letters, 117, 13, (2016); Marchal S., Francois J., State R., Engel T., PhishStorm: Detecting Phishing With Streaming Analytics, IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, 11, 4, pp. 458-471, (2014)","","Mohan J.; Chaturvedi B.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","9th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication, ICSC 2023","21 December 2023 through 23 December 2023","Noida","197666","","979-835038320-1","","","English","Int.

Our research design utilizes an extensive dataset of 165 business reports, 36 government documents, and 2,331 media articles published over the past 20 years. We employ a computational social science approach, combining BERTopic modeling with qualitative assessment to extract themes and narratives. The findings show that public discourse on quantum technology (QT) reflects prevailing social and political agendas, focusing on technical and commercial potential, global conflicts, national strategies, and social issues. Media articles provide the most balanced coverage, while business and government discourses often overlook societal implications. We emphasize the importance of informed and broad public discourse to ensure equitable and beneficial outcomes for society. © 2024 IEEE.","BERTopic Modeling; Natural Language Processing; Quantum Technology;

Reversible logic efficiently prevents energy wastage through thermal dissipation. This study presents a comprehensive exploration introducing new carry-select adders (CSLA) based on quantum and reversible logic. Five reversible CSLA designs are proposed and compared, evaluating various criteria, including speed, quantum cost, and area, compared to previously published schemes. These comparative metrics are formulated for arbitrary n-bit size blocks. Each design type is described generically, capable of implementing carry-select adders of any size. As the best outcome, this study proposes an optimized reversible adder circuit that addresses quantum propagation delay, achieving an acceptable trade-off with quantum cost compared to its counterparts. This article reduces calculation delay by 66%, 73%, 82%, and 87% for 16, 32, 64, and 128 bits, respectively, while maintaining a lower quantum cost in all cases. © 2013 IEEE.","Carry select adder; quantum computing; quantum cost; quantum delay; reversible logic","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Costs; Delay circuits; Economic and social effects; Logic gates; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Carry select adders; Cost-efficient; Delay; Digital system; High Speed; Quantum Computing; Quantum cost, quantum delay; Quantum costs; Reversible Logic; Adders","","","","","","","Landauer R., Irreversibility and heat generation in the computing process, IBM J.

In recent years, both quantum computing and machine learning have shown great promise in the field of document classification. However, there is a lack of research investigating the performance of these techniques on the Arabic language. This paper presents a comparative study of quantum computing and machine learning for two datasets of Arabic language document classification. In the first dataset of 213,465 Arabic tweets, both classic machine learning (ML) and quantum computing approaches achieve high accuracy in sentiment analysis, with quantum computing slightly outperforming classic ML. Quantum computing completes the task in approximately 59 min, slightly faster than classic ML, which takes around 1 h. The precision, recall, and F1 score metrics indicate the effectiveness of both approaches in predicting sentiment in Arabic tweets. Classic ML achieves precision, recall, and F1 score values of 0.8215, 0.8175, and 0.8121, respectively, while quantum computing achieves values of 0.8239, 0.8199, and 0.8147, respectively. In the second dataset of 44,000 tweets, both classic ML (using the Random Forest algorithm) and quantum computing demonstrate significantly reduced processing times compared to the first dataset, with no substantial difference between them. Classic ML completes the analysis in approximately 2 min, while quantum computing takes approximately 1 min and 53 s. The accuracy of classic ML is higher at 0.9241 compared to 0.9205 for quantum computing. However, both approaches achieve high precision, recall, and F1 scores, indicating their effectiveness in accurately predicting sentiment in the dataset. Classic ML achieves precision, recall, and F1 score values of 0.9286, 0.9241, and 0.9249, respectively, while quantum computing achieves values of 0.92456, 0.9205, and 0.9214, respectively. The analysis of the metrics indicates that quantum computing approaches are effective in identifying positive instances and capturing relevant sentiment information in large datasets. On the other hand, traditional machine learning techniques exhibit faster processing times when dealing with smaller dataset sizes. This study provides valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of quantum computing and machine learning for Arabic document classification, emphasizing the potential of quantum computing in achieving high accuracy, particularly in scenarios where traditional machine learning techniques may encounter difficulties. These findings contribute to the development of more accurate and efficient document classification systems for Arabic data. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","Computing Methodologies; Humans; Language; Machine Learning; Quantum Theory; Sentiment Analysis; Social Media; Arabic (language); article; comparative study; controlled study; human; human experiment; machine learning; random forest; recall; sentiment analysis; social media; computer analysis; language; machine learning; quantum theory; sentiment analysis","","","","","Department of Computer Science, Saarland University","Authors sincerely acknowledge Computer Science Department in Faculty of Science, Minia University for the facilities and support.","Muaad A.Y., Et al., Arabic document classification: Performance investigation of preprocessing and representation techniques, Math.

The primary aim is to assess their performance and delineate the current limitations and challenges associated with the application of these classifiers to complex tasks. The IMDB movie review dataset serves as a real-world example, while a generated dataset is employed for a simplified benchmark. The findings indicate that, although both classifiers exhibit potential in sentiment analysis, their performance on real-world datasets is impeded by factors such as limited qubit numbers, noise, and error rates in contemporary quantum hardware. This study underscores the necessity for advancements in quantum hardware and algorithms to enhance performance in sentiment analysis tasks and offers insights into potential avenues for future research. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Quantum Algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Sentiment Analysis","Classification (of information); Machine learning; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Machine-learning; Performance; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Real-world datasets; Sentiment analysis; Support vector classifiers; Synthetic datasets; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Zhang L., Liu B., Sentiment analysis and opinion mining, Encyclopedia of Machine Learning and Data Mining, (2012); Biamonte J., Wittek P., Pancotti N., Rebentrost P., Wiebe N., Lloyd S., Quantum machine learning, Nature, 549, 7671, pp. 195-202, (2017); Cerezo M., Verdon G., Huang H.Y., Cincio L., Coles P.J., Challenges and opportunities in quantum machine learning, Nat.

Combining Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Big Data Analytics, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Blockchain, and Cloud Computing has sped, more accurate, less expensively revolutionised the way things are done. Computational drug design and genomics have hastened molecular screening and target selection; predictive modelling based on artificial intelligence has made testing how well medications function simpler. Finding new patients, customising medications, and monitoring pharmaceuticals after they have been sold have all become simpler using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and Real-World Data (RWD). Using virtual screening techniques and high-throughput screening (HTS) has accelerated the search for novel medications and rendered traditional testing procedures less relevant. Blockchain technology simultaneously ensures accurate data, adherence to rules, and safe pharmaceutical operations as well as precise legislation. Big challenges include artificial intelligence model bias, data privacy concerns, complex rules, and systems unable to interact with one another still exist even with these developments. We must establish moral guidelines, open artificial intelligence systems, and uniform standards if we are to address these issues. Future pharmaceutical research will be much improved by synthetic biology, deep learning, and quantum computing. This will improve patient outcomes and hasten the development of fresh medications. This paper demonstrates the significance of Medical Information Science to modern medications as well as how it may inspire fresh ideas in healthcare worldwide. © 2024; Los autores.","Artificial Intelligence; Big Data Analytics; Drug Discovery; Machine Learning; Medical Information Sciencel; Predictive Modeling","","","","","","","","Paul D., Sanap G., Shenoy S., Kalyane D., Kalia K., Tekade R.K., Artificial intelligence in drug discovery and development, Drug Discov.

To maximize the accuracy of a QNN on a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computer, approximate synthesis modifies the QNN circuit by reducing error-prone 2-qubit quantum gates. The success of QNNs motivates adversaries to attack QNNs via backdoors. However, naively transplanting backdoors designed for classical neural networks to QNNs yields only low attack success rate, due to the noises and approximate synthesis on NISQ computers. Prior quantum circuit-based backdoors cannot selectively attack some inputs or work with all types of encoding layers of a QNN circuit. Moreover, it is easy to detect both transplanted and circuit-based backdoors in a QNN. In this paper, we propose a novel and stealthy backdoor attack, QDoor, to achieve high attack success rate in approximately-synthesized QNN circuits by weaponizing unitary differences between uncompiled QNNs and their synthesized counterparts. QDoor trains a QNN behaving normally for all inputs with and without a trigger. However, after approximate synthesis, the QNN circuit always predicts any inputs with a trigger to a predefined class while still acts normally for benign inputs. Compared to prior backdoor attacks, QDoor improves the attack success rate by 13x and the clean data accuracy by 65% on average. Furthermore, prior backdoor detection techniques cannot find QDoor attacks in uncompiled QNN circuits. © 2023 IEEE.","Approximate Synthesis; Backdoor Attack; Quantum Neural Network; Variational Quantum Circuit","Object recognition; Timing circuits; Approximate synthesis; Backdoor attack; Backdoors; Natural languages; Objects recognition; Quanta computers; Quantum circuit; Quantum neural networks; Synthesised; Variational quantum circuit; Natural language processing systems","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (CCF-1908992, CCF-1909509, CNS-2143120, CCF-2105972, 1909509); National Science Foundation, NSF","This work was supported in part by NSF CCF-1908992, CCF-1909509, CCF-2105972, and NSF CAREER AWARD CNS-2143120.","Chu C., Chia N.-H., Jiang L., Chen F., Qmlp: An error-tolerant nonlinear quantum mlp architecture using parameterized two-qubit gates, ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design, (2022); Wang H., Li Z., Gu J., Ding Y., Pan D.Z., Han S., Qoc: Quantum on-chip training with parameter shift and gradient pruning, ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference, (2022); Chen S.Y.-C., Yoo S., Fang Y.-L.L., Quantum long short-term memory, Ieee International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, (2022); Egger D.J., Gambella C., Marecek J., McFaddin S., Mevissen M., Raymond R., Simonetto A., Woerner S., Yndurain E., Quantum computing for finance: State-of-the-art and future prospects, Ieee Transactions on Quantum Engineering, 1, pp. 1-24, (2020); Liu Y., Ma S., Aafer Y., Lee W., Zhai J., Wang W., Zhang X., Trojaning attack on neural networks, Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, (2018); Gu T., Liu K., Dolan-Gavitt B., Garg S., Badnets: Evaluating backdooring attacks on deep neural networks, Ieee Access, (2019); Chu C., Jiang L., Swany M., Chen F., Qtrojan: A circuit backdoor against quantum neural networks, Ieee International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, (2023); Patel T., Younis E., Iancu C., De Jong W., Tiwari D., Quest: Systematically approximating quantum circuits for higher output fidelity, Acm International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, (2022); Younis E., Sen K., Yelick K., Iancu C., Qfast: Conflating search and numerical optimization for scalable quantum circuit synthesis, Ieee International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, (2021); Younis E., Iancu C., Quantum circuit optimization and transpilation via parameterized circuit instantiation, Ieee International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, (2022); Preskill J., Quantum computing in the nisq era and beyond, Quantum, (2018); Wang B., Yao Y., Shan S., Li H., Viswanath B., Zheng H., Zhao B.Y., Neural Cleanse: Identifying and Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Neural Networks, Ieee Symposium on Security and Privacy, (2019); Weigold M., Barzen J., Leymann F., Salm M., Data encoding patterns for quantum computing, Acm Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs, (2022); Wilson E., Mueller F., Bassman L., Iancu C., Empirical evaluation of circuit approximations on noisy quantum devices, Acm International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis, (2021); Wang H., Ding Y., Gu J., Lin Y., Pan D.Z., Chong F.T., Han S., QuantumNAS: Noise-Adaptive Search for Robust Quantum Circuits, Ieee International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, (2022); Hong S., Frigo P., Kaya Y., Giuffrida C., Dumitras T., Terminal brain damage: Exposing the graceless degradation in deep neural networks under hardware fault attacks, The Usenix Conference on Security Symposium, (2019); Deutsch D.E., Quantum computational networks, The Royal Society of London.

Traditional encryption methods face obsolescence in the quantum era, as quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm can efficiently break widely used cryptographic schemes. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their capacity for processing and analyzing vast amounts of data, have emerged as valuable tools in addressing privacy concerns in quantum computing environments. This chapter explores how LLMs can be leveraged to enhance privacy and data protection by facilitating the development of quantum- resistant cryptographic protocols, automating threat detection, and assisting in the creation of novel security architectures tailored to quantum technologies. By examining the intersection of LLMs and quantum computing, this work highlights their potential to reshape cybersecurity strategies to ensure that data remains secure in a post- quantum world. © 2025 by IGI Global Scientific Publishing.

The compositional aspect of sentence and discourse units is often overlooked by machine learning algorithms. A recent initiative called Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) learns word meanings as points in a Hilbert space and acts on them via a translation of grammatical structure into Parametrised Quantum Circuits (PQCs). Previous work extended the QNLP translation to discourse structure using points in a closure of Hilbert spaces. In this paper, we evaluate this translation on a Winograd-style pronoun resolution task. We train a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) for binary classification and implement an end-to-end pronoun resolution system. The simulations executed on IBMQ software converged with an F1 score of 87.20%. The model outperformed two out of three classical coreference resolution systems and neared state-of-the-art SpanBERT. A mixed quantum-classical model yet improved these results with an F1 score increase of around 6%. © 2023 EMNLP 2023 - Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Computational Models of Reference, Anaphora and Coreference, CRAC 2023.

At the same time, in the area of quantum computing (QC), with the steady growth of quantum hardware and notable improvements towards implementations of quantum algorithms, we are approaching an era when quantum computers perform tasks that cannot be done on classical computers with a reasonable amount of resources. This provides an new range of opportunities for AI, and for NLP specifically. In this work, we work with the Categorical Distributional Compositional (DisCoCat) model of natural language meaning, whose underlying mathematical underpinnings make it amenable to quantum instantiations. Earlier work on fault-tolerant quantum algorithms has already demonstrated potential quantum advantage for NLP, notably employing DisCoCat. In this work, we focus on the capabilities of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware and perform the first implementation of an NLP task on a NISQ processor, using the DisCoCat framework. Sentences are instantiated as parameterised quantum circuits; word-meanings are embedded in quantum states using parameterised quantum-circuits and the sentence’s grammatical structure faithfully manifests as a pattern of entangling operations which compose the word-circuits into a sentence-circuit. The circuits’ parameters are trained using a classical optimiser in a supervised NLP task of binary classification. Our novel QNLP model shows concrete promise for scalability as the quality of the quantum hardware improves in the near future and solidifies a novel branch of experimental research at the intersection of QC and AI. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Compositionality; Natural language processing; Quantum computing; String diagrams","Computer hardware; Qubits; Compositionality; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Parameterized; Quanta computers; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; String diagram; Natural language processing systems","","","","","Wolfson Harrison UK Research Council Quantum Foundation; Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851","KM is grateful to the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 for financial support under a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship.

The model is based on the authors' explorations on the identification of tweets meanings. The main idea is to apply the latest developed quantum machine learning method to the hierarchical classification models of texts. This approach avoids the text corpus necessity and supports the online learning due to the very design. The model proposed is tested in the experiment. The target content was given in the experiment and the model is used to measure the correspondence between the target topics and the test messages. The result of the experiment shows that the proposed method allows to distinguish the target content in the test text. © 2024 IEEE.","expert system; natural language model; online learning; short messages; tweets","E-learning; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Classification models; Hierarchical classification; Machine learning methods; Natural language model; Online learning; Quantum machines; Short message; Text corpora; Tweet; Expert systems","","","","","","","LeCun Y., Boser B., Denker J.S., Henderson D., Howard R.E., Hubbard W., Jackel L.D., Backpropagation Applied to Handwritten Zip Code Recognition, Neural Computation, 1, 4, pp. 541-551, (1989); Krizhevsky A., Sutskever I., Hinton G.E., ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks, Communications of the ACM, 60, 6, pp. 84-90, (2012); Kim Y., Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification, Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 1746-1751, (2014); Bahdanau D., Cho K., Bengio Y., Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate, (2014); Vaswani A., Shazeer N., Parmar N., Uszkoreit J., Jones L., Gomez A.N., Polosukhin I., Attention is all you need, Advances in neural information processing systems, 30, (2017); Radford A., Narasimhan K., Salimans T., Sutskever I., Improving language understanding by generative pre-training, (2018); Devlin J., Chang M., Lee K., Toutanova K.N., BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, (2018); Kolmogorov A.N., Information theory and theory of algorithms, Selected works, URSS, 3, pp. 264-2005; Uspensky V.A., Preface for readers of the New Literary Review to the semiotic messages of A.

This paper explores a novel implementation of sentiment analysis using the Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) framework. As ansatz choice determines model performance in VQA, this paper proposes an alternative ansatz for the sentiment classification task in quantum representation. Specifically, it builds upon previous work in quantum sentiment classification by proposing an alternative ansatz to the Instantaneous Quantum Polytime ansatz, entitled Simple Sentiment Analysis (SimpleSA) ansatz. A key feature of the SimpleSA ansatz is the decision to neglect noun parameterization. The proposed SimpleSA has less complexity than the other ansätze in terms of the number of parameters and the number of gates. Moreover, experimental results show that the SimpleSA ansatz with H-CNOT-Rz-H compound block construction outperforms the Instantaneous Quantum Polytime (IQP) ansatz at 85.00% accuracy. Furthermore, SimpleSA optimization converges 20.89% faster than Instantaneous Quantum Polytime (IQP) for the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) method with 130 iterations. The proposed work is useful for applications of quantum computers for sentiment analyses and classifications.  © 2013 IEEE.","ansatz; quantum circuit; quantum machine learning; Quantum natural language processing; sentiment classification","Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Optimization; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Stochastic systems; Timing circuits; Ansatz; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Quantum circuit; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum natural language processing; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Coecke B., Sadrzadeh M., Clark S., Mathematical foundations for a compositional distributional model of meaning, (2010); Preskill J., Quantum computing in the NISQ era and beyond, Quantum, 2, (2018); Cerezo M., Arrasmith A., Babbush R., Benjamin S.C., Endo S., Fujii K., McClean J.R., Mitarai K., Yuan X., Cincio L., Coles P.J., Variational quantum algorithms, Nature Rev.

The rapid advancement of quantum computing necessitates new tools to streamline this development process, and one such tool could be Generative Artificial intelligence (GenAI). In this study, we introduce and use the Qiskit HumanEval dataset, a hand-curated collection of tasks designed to benchmark the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce quantum code using Qiskit - a quantum SDK. This dataset consists of more than 100 quantum computing tasks, each accompanied by a prompt, a canonical solution, a comprehensive test case, and a difficulty scale to evaluate the correctness of the generated solutions. We systematically assess the performance of a set of LLMs against the Qiskit HumanEval dataset's tasks and focus on the models ability in producing executable quantum code.

Electrical engineering forms the foundation of modern technology, powering industries, and innovation. It enables efficient energy use, energy conservation, integration of renewable resources, and optimization through power electronics. The future of electrical engineering lies in integrating the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and automation, and energy storage innovations. The increasingly intricate and interconnected nature of modern power systems predicates a substantial reliance on advanced data processing and analytical capabilities to ensure efficient operation, reliability, and integration of renewable energy resources. Machine learning (ML) has surfaced as a formidable tool to confront these challenges by providing sophisticated means to analyze the massive volumes of data generated by the grid and facilitate real-time decision-making and predictive insights. Integrating ML techniques in power systems has brought about significant advancements in monitoring, controlling, and optimizing electrical networks. This chapter delves into the progressive trends of ML applications in power systems and explores the prospective landscapes these computational techniques are poised to transform.

In quantum-computing theory, the vectors corresponding to quantum states are all complex values, so there is a gap between these two areas. Presently, complex-valued neural networks have been studied, but their practical applications are few, let alone in the downstream tasks of natural language processing such as sentiment analysis and language modeling. In fact, the complex-valued neural network can use the imaginary part information to embed hidden information and can express more complex information, which is suitable for modeling complex natural language. Meanwhile, quantum-inspired models are defined in Hilbert space, which is also a complex space. So it is natural to construct quantum-inspired models based on complex-valued neural networks. Therefore, we propose a new quantum-inspired model for NLP, ComplexQNN, which contains a complex-valued embedding layer, a quantum encoding layer, and a measurement layer. The modules of ComplexQNN are fully based on complex-valued neural networks. It is more in line with quantum-computing theory and easier to transfer to quantum computers in the future to achieve exponential acceleration. We conducted experiments on six sentiment-classification datasets comparing with five classical models (TextCNN, GRU, ELMo, BERT, and RoBERTa). The results show that our model has improved by 10% in accuracy metric compared with TextCNN and GRU, and has competitive experimental results with ELMo, BERT, and RoBERTa. © 2023 by the authors.","machine learning; natural language processing; quantum theory; sentiment analysis","","","","","","Open Fund of Advanced Cryptography and System Security Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, (SKLACSS-202107); Special Foundation for Distinguished Young Scientists of Changsha, (kq1905058); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61972418, 62272483); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Education Department of Henan Province, (22B0001); Education Department of Henan Province","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 62272483, 61972418), the Education Department of Hunan Province of China (Grant Nos. 22B0001), the Special Foundation for Distinguished Young Scientists of Changsha (Grant Nos. kq1905058) and the Open Fund of Advanced Cryptography and System Security Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province (Grant Nos.

In this paper, we present results on the first NLP experiments conducted on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers for datasets of size greater than 100 sentences. Exploiting the formal similarity of the compositional model of meaning by Coecke, Sadrzadeh, and Clark (2010) with quantum theory, we create representations for sentences that have a natural mapping to quantum circuits. We use these representations to implement and successfully train NLP models that solve simple sentence classification tasks on quantum hardware. We conduct quantum simulations that compare the syntax-sensitive model of Coecke et al. with two baselines that use less or no syntax; specifically, we implement the quantum analogues of a “bag-of-words” model, where syntax is not taken into account at all, and of a word-sequence model, where only word order is respected. We demonstrate that all models converge smoothly both in simulations and when run on quantum hardware, and that the results are the expected ones based on the nature of the tasks and the datasets used. Another important goal of this paper is to describe in a way accessible to AI and NLP researchers the main principles, process and challenges of experiments on quantum hardware. Our aim in doing this is to take the first small steps in this unexplored research territory and pave the way for practical Quantum Natural Language Processing. ©2023 AI Access Foundation.

We explore feature and data prototype selection techniques to address challenges posed by encoding high dimensional features. Our study builds quantum circuit classifiers that includes classical feature pre-processing, quantum embedding and quantum model training. The quantum models are built on 4 or 6 qubits and the quantum neural network (QNN) uses the established bricklayer design. We compare the dependence of model performance (in terms of accuracy and F1 scores) on feature length, embedding gates and parameterized unitary design. We compare the performance of quantum machine learning models to classical convolution neural network model (CNN) on binary and multi-class classification tasks using two datasets of synthetic features and labels. The first is the ECP-CANDLE P3B3 dataset a corpus of synthetically generated cancer pathology reports. The second dataset is extracted from well-known benchmark dataset (MADELON) - features are generated with a combination of informative, repeated and uninformative features. Both datasets are used for binary classification and multi-class classification with 3 classes. We observe robust, accurate performance from all models on the binary classification tasks, but multiclass classification is a challenge for the quantum models-there is a notable decrease in accuracy when using 3 classes. Overall the performance is comparable in terms of recall and accuracy between QNNs and CNNs, even with large datasets. These results provide a point of comparison between quantum and classical models on real-world datasets.  © 2023 IEEE.","quantum machine learning; quantum natural language processing; quantum neural networks","Classification (of information); Classifiers; Large dataset; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Qubits; Embeddings; Language processing; Machine-learning; Multi-class classification; Natural languages; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum models; Quantum natural language processing; Quantum neural networks; Embeddings","","","","","","","Coecke B., De Felice G., Meichanetzidis K., Toumi A., Foundations for near-term quantum natural language processing, (2020); Lorenz R., Pearson A., Meichanetzidis K., Kartsaklis D., Coecke B., Qnlp in practice: Running compositional models of meaning on a quantum computer, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 76, pp. 1305-1342, (2023); Guarasci R., De Pietro G., Esposito M., Quantum natural language processing: Challenges and opportunities, Appl.

This gradually becomes the main obstacle for it to tackle realistic applications, such as natural language processing, medical image processing, and wireless communications. Recently, there have emerged research efforts that enable VQCs to perform non-linear operations. However, it is still unclear on the approximability of a given VQC (i.e., the order of non-linearity that can be handled by a specified design). In response to this issue, we developed an automated tool designed to benchmark the approximation of a given VQC. The proposed tool will generate a set of synthetic datasets with different orders of non-linearity and train the given VQC on these datasets to estimate their approximability. Our experiments benchmark VQCs with different designs, where we know their theoretic approximability. We then show that the proposed tool can precisely estimate the approximability, which is consistent with the theoretic value, indicating that the proposed tool can be used for benchmarking the approximability of a given quantum circuit for learning tasks. © 2024 IEEE.","Benchmarking; Nonlinearity; Quantum Learning; Variational Quantum Circuit","Benchmarking; Hospital data processing; Medical image processing; Natural language processing systems; Quantum communication; Quantum computers; Variational techniques; Approximability; Natural languages; Neural network model; Non-linear relationships; Nonlinearity; Quantum circuit; Quantum learning; Quantum neural networks; Realistic applications; Variational quantum circuit; Quantum electronics","","","","","Los Alamos National Laboratory, LANL; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; Office of Science, SC; National Science Foundation, NSF, (2311949); National Science Foundation, NSF; National Quantum Information Science Research Centers, (DE-SC0012704); Basic Energy Sciences, BES, (PNNL FWP 76274); Basic Energy Sciences, BES; International Business Machines Corporation, IBM, (DE-AC05-00OR22725); International Business Machines Corporation, IBM","This work is partly supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) 2311949, Mason s Office of Research Innovation and Economic Impact (ORIEI), and the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, National Quantum Information Science Research Centers, Co-design Center for Quantum Advantage (C2QA) under contract number DE-SC0012704, (Basic Energy Sciences, PNNL FWP 76274).

Along with that, the chapter shows how quantum machine learning is being used in real-world settings in a variety of fields, such as drug discovery, financial modelling, image identification, and natural language processing. All fundamental subatomic particles fall into two classes, based on how identical particles of each type behave when swapped. They are either fermions, a class that includes electrons and other particles that make up matter, or bosons, which include particles of light known as photons. Data encoding is often the most crucial step of quantum machine learning with classical data. It illustrates the possible advantages and insights that quantum algorithms can offer to various fields and analyses the ongoing research projects aimed at converting conventional machine learning models for quantum platforms. © 2023, IGI Global.","","","","","","","","","","","","IGI Global","","","","","","","978-166847537-9; 1668475359; 978-166847535-5","","","English","Princ. and Appl. of Quantum Comput.

NLP classical approaches are computationally expensive due to their high-power consumption, computing power, and storage requirements. Another computationally efficient approach to NLP is categorical quantum mechanics, which combines grammatical structure and individual word meaning to deduce the sentence meaning. As both quantum theory and natural language use vector space to describe states which are more efficient on quantum hardware, QNLP models can achieve up to quadratic speedup over classical direct calculation methods. In recent years, there is significant progress in utilizing quantum features such as superposition and entanglement to represent linguistic meaning on quantum hardware. Earlier research work has already demonstrated QNLP’s potential quantum advantage in terms of speeding up search, enhancing classification tasks’ accuracy and providing an exponentially large quantum state space in which complex linguistic structures can be efficiently embedded. In this work, a QNLP model is used to determine if two sentences are related to the same topic or not. By comparing our QNLP model to a classical tensor network-based one, our model improved training accuracy by up to 45% and validation accuracy by 35%, respectively. The QNLP model convergence is also studied when varying: first, the problem size, second, parametrized quantum circuits used for model’s training, and last, the backend quantum simulator noise model.

Using BERTopic modeling, a machine learning technique, this research systematically analyzes literature from 2013 to 2024, providing an overview of AI and big data applications mapped to SDGs which is a first. This structured approach identifies key SDGs impacted by these technologies and highlights interdisciplinary methods that further enhance SDG outcomes. AI applications notably improve healthcare by advancing disease tracking, tailored treatments, and precision medicine, fostering universal healthcare and reducing noncommunicable disease mortality. In energy, AI-driven solutions optimize forecasting, grid management, and renewable integration, while in industry, they bolster infrastructure resilience through innovations like predictive maintenance and automated quality control within Industry 4.0 frameworks. The integration of automated text analysis and semantic context captures broad trends, contributing both methodologically and substantively at the intersection of AI and sustainability. Despite these advancements, the study underscores ethical concerns, including data privacy, security, and algorithmic biases. Interdisciplinary collaboration among healthcare professionals, engineers, environmental scientists, and AI experts is crucial to developing ethical, scalable AI solutions. The study suggests future research focus on AI transparency, scaling across diverse sectors, and integrating advanced techniques such as neurosymbolic AI and quantum neural networks to enhance system reliability. These insights offer practical implications, reinforcing the potential of AI and big data to address global challenges sustainably while calling for balanced attention to ethical and regulatory dimensions.  © 2013 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; big data; generative AI; healthcare; industrial innovation; resilient energy; resilient infrastructure; Sustainable development goal","Artificial intelligence algorithms; Energy; Generative artificial intelligence; Healthcare; Industrial innovation; Modeling analyzes; Resilient energy; Resilient infrastructure; Sustainable energy; Topic Modeling; Sustainable development goals","","","","","","","Xu Y., Artificial intelligence: A powerful paradigm for scientific research, Innovation, 2, 4, (2021); Nishant R., Kennedy M., Corbett J., Artificial intelligence for sustainability: Challenges, opportunities, and a research agenda, Int.

Such data can be used to improve the quality or assess the effectiveness of pharmaceutical product. This effort aims to assess the medical conditions of a patient by analyzing the text reviews of pharmaceutical products, and thereby increase the patient's healthcare quality. Recently new computing paradigms like quantum machine learning gained a lot of attention. However, it is not yet feasible to perform quantum operations on high dimensional data using current quantum hardware. Hence a hybrid approach using both classical and quantum machine learning methods has been proposed. We compared our results with the performance of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) model. The result shows the promise of quantum computing technology when used in combination with a classical machine learning approach. In comparison to the current state-of-the-art technology, where the transformer-based techniques achieved 85.7% of accuracy, our hybrid approach achieved 87.1% accuracy.  © 2023 IEEE.","BERT; Medical Drug Reviews; Natural Language Processing; Quantum Machine Learning; Variational Quantum Circuits","Clustering algorithms; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Timing circuits; Bidirectional encoder representation from transformer; Language processing; Machine-learning; Medical drug review; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Quantum circuit; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Variational quantum circuit; Consumer behavior","","","","","","","Devlin J., Chang M.-W., Lee K., Toutanova K., Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, (2019); Biamonte J., Wittek P., Pancotti N., Rebentrost P., Wiebe N., Lloyd S., Quantum machine learning, Nature, 549, 7671, pp. 195-202, (2017); Cerezo M., Arrasmith A., Babbush R., Benjamin S.C., Endo S., Fujii K., McClean J.R., Mitarai K., Yuan X., Cincio L., Et al., Variational quantum algorithms, Nature Reviews Physics, 3, 9, pp. 625-644, (2021); Mitarai K., Negoro M., Kitagawa M., Fujii K., Quantum circuit learning, Physical Review A, (2018); Graser F., Kallumadi S., Malberg H., Zaunseder S., Aspect-based sentiment analysis of drug reviews applying cross-domain and cross-data learning, Proceedings of the 2018 International Conference on Digital Health, (2018); Wang H., Ding Y., Gu J., Lin Y., Pan D.Z., Chong F.T., Han S., Quantumnas: Noise-adaptive search for robust quantum circuits, (2021); Li J., Yang X.D., Peng X., Pu Sun C., Hybrid quantum-classical approach to quantum optimal control, Physical review letters, 118, 15, (2017)","","Muller H.; Alexev Y.; Delgado A.; Byrd G.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","et al.; Microsoft; Montreal International; Q-CTRL; QBlox; Quantum Machines (QM)","4th IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2023","17 September 2023 through 22 September 2023","Bellevue","195032","","979-835034323-6","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The proposed methodology is evaluated using two distinct datasets, based on English and Bengali languages. Experimental results show that after dimensionality reduction of the data, performance of the quantum-based hybrid algorithms were consistent and better than classical methods. © 2023 IEEE.","Haar Transform; Quantum Machine Learning; Sentiment Analysis; SVM","Large datasets; Learning algorithms; Quantum computers; Sentiment analysis; Support vector machines; Haar transform; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum-classical; Sentiment analysis; SVM; Wavelet transforms","","","","","","","Liu B., Sentiment analysis and opinion mining, Springer Nature, (2022); Taherdoost H., Madanchian M., Artificial intelligence and sentiment analysis: A review in competitive research, Computers, 12, 2, (2023); Huang H., Kueng R., Preskill J., Informationtheoretic bounds on quantum advantage in machine learning, Physical Review Letters, 126, 19, (2021); Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum computation and quantum information, (2010); Biamonte J., Wittek P., Pancotti N., Rebentrost P., Wiebe N., Lloyd S., Quantum machine learning, Nature, 549, 7671, pp. 195-202, (2017); Mustajar Ahmad Shah S., Ge H., Ahmed Haider S., Irshad M., Noman S.M., Arshad Meo J., Ahmad A., Younas T., A quantum spatial graph convolutional network for text classification, Comput.

In this study, we focus on nitrogen atoms in DNA, which have a nuclear spin of 1 and are influenced by EFGs. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, quantum chemical computations, and theoretical analyses, we studied the characteristics of EFGs in the context of DNA. Our results show that the orientation patterns of the EFGs at the positions of nitrogen atoms in DNA bases vary with different types of bases and nitrogen atom sites. Consequently, the genetic and structural information of DNA is encoded into the direction of the nitrogen nuclear spins. Furthermore, the interaction and evolution of these nitrogen nuclear spins with surrounding nuclear spins suggest the potential for quantum computing of genetic information. Our findings not only provide new insights into quantum phenomena in biological systems but also lay the groundwork for expanding the theoretical foundations of DNA quantum computing and offer innovative approaches for the design of future biocompatible quantum computers. © 2024 Yu Zheng and Quansheng Ren.","","Gene encoding;

This paper considers the problem of automatically transforming existing neural networks into corresponding variational quantum circuits. In particular, given a trained neural network, the paper considers estimating the number of ansatz layers so that the corresponding circuit is not over or under-parametrized. This is achieved by constructing a dataset containing many trained neural networks each labelled with the corresponding optimal number of variational quantum layers, obtained through experimentation. The paper further performs dataset augmentation using an LLM model to speed up dataset construction. The paper then selects a set of features based on both the network architecture and the trained parameters, and then trains a feed-forward neural network. The trained network achieves 86.7% accuracy on unseen unaugmented test circuits. © 2024 IEEE.","Neural Networks; quantum machine learning; Quantum neural networks; Variational quantum classifier (VQC)","Adversarial machine learning; Image segmentation; Machine learning; Multilayer neural networks; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Variational techniques; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Parametrizations; Quanta computers; Quantum circuit; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum neural networks; Trained neural networks; Variational quantum classifier; Quantum computers","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (JPJSBP 120226002); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS; Science and Technology Development Fund, STDF, (46263); Science and Technology Development Fund, STDF","This work was supported by JSPS Bilateral Program Number JPJSBP 120226002.

The presented survey paper aims at describing fundamental techniques and taxonomy of deep learning, various applications, and potential perspectives for further research. The paper starts with presenting the concept of deep learning and its origins as well as emphasizing the important position of DL in the modern development of AI. It then goes further into deep learning workflow and frameworks and presents feedforward neural networks, CNN, RNN, generative adversarial networks, attention mechanisms, and transformers. An overview of deep learning frameworks is discussed, including supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, transfer, semi-supervised, & self-supervised learning. The survey further continues to provide a detailed description on how DL is being widely applied in CV, NLP, speech recognition, disease diagnosis & stock price forecasting.

To investigate how media covers quantum technology, an emerging technology of the 21st century, we analyzed 2,331 news articles from the US, UK, China, and India - nations at the forefront of this industry. Using BERTopic modeling and sentiment analysis, we identified six narratives containing 54 topics. Overall, news focused on quantum computing, while other technological aspects like quantum cryptography were less prevalent. Over time, a notable shift from a societal and scientific discourse to political and economic discussions was observed. This development emphasizes narratives about national strategies, commercialization, and global politics and competition, highlighting the growing rivalry, especially between the US and China. Moreover, regional sentiments varied, with more positive news coverage in Chinese and Indian media compared to the Western counterparts. These insights are vital for stakeholders directing the future of quantum technologies. © 2024 International Conference on Information Systems.

Let n and d represent the length of the sequence and the embedding size, respectively. The dot-product attention mechanism requires a time complexity of O(n2 ·d), while QNet has merely O(n+d) quantum circuit depth. In addition, we introduce ResQNet, a quantum-classical hybrid model composed of several QNet blocks linked by residual connections, as an isomorph Transformer Encoder. We evaluated our work on various natural language processing tasks, including text classification, rating score prediction, and named entity recognition. Our models exhibit compelling performance over classical state-of-the-art models with a thousand times fewer parameters.

Its theoretical results on quantum circuit mapping and quantum semantic coding of text have been tested in practice with the recent development of quantum back-end equipment. In view of the small scale of quantum natural language processing tasks, single sentence structure of quantum semantic coding, low text coverage and lack of application, this paper proposes a combination of syntactic structure to extract text and extend the sentence components of quantum semantic coding, which improves the utilization of text processing task of quantum computing resources. In view of the fact that quantum natural language processing has few cases in specific applications, this paper studies the application expansion possibility of quantum text matching and question answering applications.

With the success of deep learning (DL) in computer vision recognition, people are starting to use deep learning to tackle TSC tasks. Quantum neural networks (QNN) have recently demonstrated their superiority over traditional machine learning in methods such as image processing and natural language processing, but research using quantum neural networks to handle TSC tasks has not received enough attention. Therefore, we proposed a learning framework based on multiple imaging and hybrid QNN (MIHQNN) for TSC tasks. We investigate the possibility of converting 1D time series to 2D images and classifying the converted images using hybrid QNN. We explored the differences between MIHQNN based on single time series imaging and MIHQNN based on the fusion of multiple time series imaging. Four quantum circuits were also selected and designed to study the impact of quantum circuits on TSC tasks. We tested our method on several standard datasets and achieved significant results compared to several current TSC methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of MIHQNN. This research highlights the potential of applying quantum computing to TSC and provides the theoretical and experimental background for future research. © 2023 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.","feature fusion; quantum neural networks; time series classification; time-series images","Data mining; Deep learning; Image classification; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Classification tasks; Features fusions; Learning frameworks; Multiple imaging; Quantum circuit; Quantum neural networks; Time series classifications; Time series data mining; Time-series image; Times series; Time series","","","","","Chongqing Technology Foresight and Institutional Innovation Project, (cstc2021jsyj-yzysbAX0011); PHD foundation; Chongqing Normal University, CNU, (19XLB003); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61572270, 61772295)","Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61772295 and 61572270), the PHD foundation of Chongqing Normal University (Grant No. 19XLB003), and Chongqing Technology Foresight and Institutional Innovation Project (Grant No. cstc2021jsyj-yzysbAX0011).","Paparrizos J, Gravano L, ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS), (2017); Lines J, Bagnall A, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 29, (2015); Xiao X, Lu Y, 6th Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar November 26-29, (2019); Geler Z, Kurbalija V, Ivanovi M, Radovanovi M, International Conference on Innovations in Intelligent Systems and Applications (INISTA), (2020); Buza K, Nanopoulos A, Schmidt-Thieme L, 13th IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering, (2010); Morchen F, Ultsch A, Thies M, Lohken I, IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 14, (2005); Lin J, Keogh E, Wei L, Lonardi S, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 15, (2007); Biamonte J, Wittek P, Pancotti N, Rebentrost P, Wiebe N, Lloyd S, Nature, (2017); Rebentrost P, Mohseni M, Lloyd S, Phys.

This technique essentially reduces the quantum video classification problem into a quantum text classification problem. The text-based quantum circuits generated for videos also serve the purpose of acting as a new type of dataset for further research on quantum video processing.

MQSAPN comprises two components, one is the Multi-head Quantum Self-Attention (MQSA) model, and the other is the predicting Variational Quantum Circuits (pVQC). When fed with sequential inputs, the MQSA firstly computes the key, query, and value vectors corresponding to all time steps through the variational circuits, and then according to exist studies, the attention is estimated via Gaussian function. With residual link on input and multi-head features, the output of MQSA were pushed to pVQC part, which was encoded into quantum circuit again, and the prediction would be ultimately calculated out by measurements on observables. The prediction results of MQSAPN numerical experiments on atmospheric variables indicate the effectiveness of quantum self-attention, by comparison with the results of a data-reuploading VQC model with almost same amount of parameters. The accuracy of predicting is close to classic multi-head transformer model and LSTM net. To be noted, as input time window extends or the more features are adopted, the number of parameters of pVQC will also increases correspondingly, which makes the pVQC part become the bottleneck of the whole model due to ‘barren plateau’ problems during training process. © 2024 Univ. of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

The traditional patent citation analysis only analyzes the patent data marked in the patent documents, which cannot accurately and honestly reflect the citation relationship between patents. It is difficult to reveal the technical similarity between patents accurately. Identifying patent semantic references is conducive to accurately and genuinely revealing the potential semantic relationship between patents, providing a reference for the inheritance and innovation evaluation of patents, and helping patent review before patent authorization and patent evaluation after patent authorization. [Method/ process] Firstly, the feature knowledge elements of patents are extracted based on rules and syntax analysis. Secondly, the Sentence-BERT and Word2Vec models are used to express the patent feature knowledge elements and the patent title abstract text quantitatively. Thirdly, the feature similarity and overall similarity of patents are calculated according to cosine similarity, and the semantic reference patent set of patents is obtained by combining the sequence of patent application dates. Finally, experimental research was carried out using patent data in the field of quantum computing. [Result/ conclusion] This method can realize the effective recognition of semantic reference patents, which is conducive to the evaluation of technical novelty, creativity, and practicability of patents, and provides support for patent review and patent value evaluation. © 2023 Information studies: Theory and Application.

DL technology originated from artificial neural networks and, due to the ability to learn directly from data, has become a hot topic in the context of computing, with a multitude of applications in areas like health care, visual recognition, natural language processing, cybersecurity, and many more. The aim of this chapter is to give the reader an overview of traditional ML algorithms, such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision tree, random forests, and Naïve Bayesian, as well as more advanced DL models and learning methods such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and general adaptive networks. Finally, after discussing the shortcomings of the most common ML algorithms, we will introduce alternative approaches such as reservoir computing, quantum ML, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and clustering algorithm. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Some research works substantially exploit Machine Learning algorithms to identify threats conducted on vehicles, particularly on the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Therefore, it is necessary not only to use Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) to identify attacks but also to help the engineers in the automotive field understand the dangerousness of the attack and help them resolve the vulnerability. With the increasing attention to Quantum Computing (QC), QC-based Artificial Intelligence algorithms have become very popular among many researchers for improving the prediction and the time performance to identify an attack.

This research paper presents a novel approach to revolutionize the staffing and recruiting industry by integrating Knowledge Graph (KG) and Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) to formulate an end-to-end QNLP training pipeline. The proposed solution consists of three interdependent subsystems that work in unison to construct contextual KG and train language models. The Information Extraction subsystem extracts semantic relationships and connections between entities from large and complex recruitment data to construct domain specific contextual KG. The QNLP model training pipeline subsystem, which is fed with domain-rich KG data, runs on Quantum Circuits, accelerates the training process by effectively incorporating high-dimensional features to the deep layers of language models. Finally, the Information Retrieval subsystem is based on semantic data taxonomy, retrieving contextual data from the KG for the trained language models to be implemented on various distinctive use cases in the staffing and recruiting industry. This solution provides a faster and more contextual approach to analyze recruitment data, empowering recruiters to concentrate on strategic tasks such as candidate engagement and client relationship building, ultimately leading to better business decision-making capabilities. © 2023 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Contextual Information Extraction & Retrieval Systems; Knowledge Graph (KG); Large Language Models (LLM); Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP)","Computational linguistics; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Knowledge graph; Natural language processing systems; Pipeline processing systems; Pipelines; Search engines; Semantics; Artificial intelligence; Contextual information; Contextual information extraction & retrieval system; Information extraction systems; Information-retrieval systems; Knowledge graph; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Natural languages; Quantum natural language processing; Decision making","","","","","","","Ji S., Pan S., Cambria E., Marttinen P., Yu P.S., A survey on knowledge graphs: Representation, acquisition, and applications, IEEE Trans.

Moreover, the field of natural language processing (NLP) is rapidly attracting researchers and engineers in order to build larger model computations of NLP. Thus, the use of quantum technology in NLP tasks, especially sentiment classification, has the potential to be developed. In this research, we investigate the best technique to represent sentiment sentences so that sentiment can be analyzed using the Quantum-Enhanced Support Vector Machine (QE-SVM) algorithm. Investigations were carried out using circuit parameter optimization methods and data transformation. The pipeline of the proposed method consists of sentence-to-circuit conversion, circuit parameter training, state vector formation, and finally the training and testing processes. As a result, we obtained the best classification results with an accuracy of 93.33% using the SPSA optimization method and PCA transformation data. These results have also outperformed the baseline SVM method.  © 2013 IEEE.","quantum representation; quantum-enhanced; Sentiment classification; SVM","Job analysis; Metadata; Optimization; Quantum computers; Support vector machines; Vectors; Kernel; Quantum Computing; Quantum representation; Quantum-enhanced; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Support vectors machine; SVM; Task analysis; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Liu B., Sentiment Analysis: Mining Opinions, Sentiments, and Emotions; Vyas V., Uma V., Approaches to sentiment analysis on product reviews, Sentiment Analysis and Knowledge Discovery in Contemporary Business, pp. 15-30, (2019); Unankard S., Li X., Sharaf M., Zhong J., Li X., Predicting elections from social networks based on sub-event detection and sentiment analysis, Proc. 15th Int.

Such algorithms learn the function that maps input to output from the training examples. The algorithms are evaluated with the validation data and then used to predict the output for an unknown dataset. For the past few years, scholars have been researching to improve such classical machine learning algorithms using quantum computing. Some of the latest research is the optimization of computationally expensive algorithms with quantum computing and transforming stochastic procedures into the semantics of quantum theory. The quest for the learning-based algorithm is aspiring: the discipline seeks to comprehend what learning is and studies how algorithms approximate learning. Quantum machine learning takes these aspirations further by looking at the subatomic level to aid learning. Machine learning-based algorithms minimize a constrained multivariate function. Different algorithms have different hyper-parameters that need to be tuned for the trained model to generalize well. Such optimization has high time and space complexity, which is central to learning theory. This contribution gives an organized overview of the evolving arena of quantum machine learning. It presents the methods as well as practical details. We start this chapter by introducing the major components of Quantum Computers, where we provide an overview of quantum computing with an in-depth explanation of the superposition of state, which will be crucial for all quantum algorithms. Next, we exploit a fascinating phenomenon called entanglement in quantum computations. Parallelism is the key to speeding up the training process of learning algorithms. One of the significant advantages of quantum computing is quantum parallelism which we will explore through Grover's search algorithm. Next, we go over the learning mechanism of a traditional machine learning algorithm, namely a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on classical computers. Furthermore, we exploit the Quantum SVM (QSVM) trained on quantum computers. Finally, we solve the famous malignant breast cancer classification problem using the quantum SVM algorithm. We study various simulations in Python language on the mentioned dataset to analyze their time complexity and performances on standard evaluation metrics, namely accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Two simulations are conducted using classical machine learning algorithms using the Python library Scikit-learn. Finally, the last simulation is based on IBM's real quantum computer using its quantum machine learning library called Qiskit. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Breast cancer classification; QSVM; Quantum computing","","","","","","","","Feynman R.P., Simulating physics with computers, Int.

Although the phenomenon is new, it has already proved its worth in various fields like finance and chemistry. The potential of quantum computing and its extraordinary properties enable us to process data in a way classical computer can never think of. When machine learning gets the power of quantum computing, information processing is enhanced significantly. In this paper, we have used variational quantum classifiers to classify questions from two domains of SelQA dataset. We keep the focus on the implications of circuit-depth in different experiments and analyze the results. VQC performs well with 11 features on lowest circuit depths and gives a testing accuracy of 58%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Quantum computing; Quantum natural language processing; Question classification; SelQA; Variational quantum classifier","","","","","","","","Schuld M., Petruccione F., Supervised Learning with Quantum Computers, (2018); Biamonte J., Wittek P., Pancotti N., Rebentrost P., Wiebe N., Lloyd S., Quantum machine learning, Nature, 549, 7671, pp. 195-202, (2017); Silva J., Coheur L., Mendes A.C., Wichert A., From symbolic to subsymbolic information in question classification, Artif Intell Rev, 35, 2, pp. 137-154, (2011); Hermjakob U., Parsing and question classification for question answering, Proceedings of the ACL 2001 Workshop on Open-Domain Question Answering, (2001); Zhang D., Lee W.S., Question classification using support vector machines, Proceedings of the 26Th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pp. 26-32, (2003); Applied Energy, (2018); Metzler D., Croft W.B., Analysis of statistical question classification for fact-based questions, Inf Retrieval, 8, 3, pp. 481-504, (2005); Huang Z., Thint M., Qin Z., Question classification using head words and their hypernyms, Proceedings of the 2008 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 927-936, (2008); Li Y., Su L., Chen J., Yuan L., Semi-supervised learning for question classification in CQA, Nat Comput, 16, 4, pp. 567-577, (2017); Liu Y., Yi X., Chen R., Zhai Z., Gu J., Feature extraction based on information gain and sequential pattern for English question classification, IET Softw, 12, 6, pp. 520-526, (2018); Aimeur E., Brassard G., Gambs S., Machine learning in a quantum world, 2006 Conference of the Canadian Society for Computational Studies of Intelligence, pp. 431-442, (2006); Schuld M., Sinayskiy I., Petruccione F., An introduction to quantum machine learning, Contemp Phys, 56, 2, pp. 172-185, (2015); Grant E., Benedetti M., Cao S., Hallam A., Lockhart J., Stojevic V., Green A.G., Severini S., Hierarchical quantum classifiers, Npj Quantum Inf, 4, 1, pp. 1-8, (2018); Ciliberto C., Herbster M., Ialongo A.D., Pontil M., Rocchetto A., Severini S., Wossnig L., Quantum machine learning: A classical perspective, Proc Royal Soc A: Math Phy Eng Sci, 474, 2209, (2018); Kusumoto T., Mitarai K., Fujii K., Kitagawa M., Negoro M., Experimental Quantum Kernel Machine Learning with Nuclear Spins in a Solid.

As quantum technology matures, the need for robust, scalable, and efficient software development practices becomes increasingly critical. This paper proposes a novel DevOps framework tailored specifically for quantum software development, addressing unique challenges posed by quantum computing. The proposed architecture incorporates continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, optimized for quantum algorithms, facilitating seamless integration and deployment of quantum applications. Key components include a Quantum Circuit Service for circuit design and optimization, a Quantum CI Service for continuous integration, and a comprehensive testing suite encompassing unit, integration, functional, and probabilistic testing. The framework emphasizes the use of large language models (LLMs) for automated microservice code generation, Kubernetes (K8s) cluster deployment for scalable infrastructure management, and a central quantum artifacts registry for efficient version control and resource management. A significant portion of this paper is dedicated to addressing the unique aspects of quantum computing, including the probabilistic nature of quantum algorithms, the need for specialized testing strategies, and the integration of classical and quantum software components. The proposed framework not only enhances the efficiency and reliability of quantum software development but also provides a structured approach to managing the complexities associated with quantum computing. © 2024 IEEE.","DevOps;

To explore the structural relationships between quantum theory and natural languages Lambeq toolkit was created. This first high-level open-source Python toolkit for quantum natural language processing offers a fully automated quantum machine learning pipeline. Lambeq currently includes five compositional models that use varying degrees of syntactic information. While the previous studies focus on Discocat model, the aim of this study is to conducte an extensive evaluation of various classifiers based on different compositional models for text classification applications, focusing on the potential advantages of ensemble learning. The classifiers, including Spider, Cups, Stairs, Tree, and DisCoCat, were examined on two datasets: MC and RP. Performance evaluation was carried out using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as the metrics. The results revealed notable variations in the performance of the classifiers across the datasets. Spider emerged as the top-performing classifier on the MC dataset, achieving remarkable scores of 100% in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. However, on the RP dataset, Stairs outperformed the other classifiers with an accuracy of 68%, precision of 71%, recall of 68%, and F1-score of 69%. Furthermore, ensemble models using hard voting and soft voting techniques were constructed and evaluated. The ensemble models showcased improved performance compared to individual classifiers, with the soft voting ensemble achieving a score of 97% for all metrics on the MC dataset, and a precision of 72% and F1-score of 68% on the RP dataset. These findings highlight the potential benefits of ensemble learning in enhancing the overall performance of text classification tasks on both the MC and RP datasets using soft voting method, allowing for more accurate and reliable predictions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ensemble Learning; Quantum machine learning; Quantum natural language processing; Quantum Text Classifier","Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; High level languages; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Quantum entanglement; Stairs; Text processing; Ensemble learning; F1 scores; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum natural language processing; Quantum text classifier; Text classifiers; Machine learning","","","","","","","Coecke B., de Felice G., Meichanetzidis K., Toumi A., Foundations for Near-Term Quantum Natural Language Processing.

Security concerns motivate the development of quantum pre-training. In this work, we propose a highly portable quantum language model (PQLM) that can easily transmit information to downstream tasks on classical machines. The framework consists of a cloud PQLM built with random Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC) and local models for downstream applications. We demonstrate the ad hoc portability of the quantum model by extracting only the word embeddings and effectively applying them to downstream tasks on classical machines. Our PQLM exhibits comparable performance to its classical counterpart on both intrinsic evaluation (loss, perplexity) and extrinsic evaluation (multilingual sentiment analysis accuracy) metrics. We also perform ablation studies on the factors affecting PQLM performance to analyze model stability. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for a portable quantum pre-trained language model that could be trained on private data and made available for public use with privacy protection guarantees. © 2023 IEEE.","Federated Learning; Language Modeling; Model Portability; Quantum Machine Learning","Computational linguistics; Learning systems; Modeling languages; Decentralised; Down-stream; Federated learning; Language model; Machine-learning; Malicious agent; Model portability; Private information; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Bommasani R., Hudson D.A., Adeli E., Altman R., Arora S., Von Arx S., Bernstein M.S., Bohg J., Bosselut A., Brunskill E., Et al., On the opportunities and risks of foundation models, (2021); Wu S., Zhao X., Yu T., Zhang R., Shen C., Liu H., Li F., Zhu H., Luo J., Xu L., Zhang X., Yuan 1. 0: Large-scale pre-trained language model in zero-shot and few-shot learning, (2021); Shi W., Cui A., Li E., Jia R., Yu Z., Selective differential privacy for language modeling, Proceedings of the 2022 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pp. 2848-2859, (2022); Carlini N., Liu C., Erlingsson U., Kos J., Song D., The secret sharer: Evaluating and testing unintended memorization in neural networks, 28th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 19), pp. 267-284, (2019); Carlini N., Tramer F., Wallace E., Jagielski M., Herbert-Voss A., Lee K., Roberts A., Brown T., Song D., Erlingsson U., Oprea A., Raffel C., Extracting training data from large language models, 30th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 21)., pp. 2633-2650, (2021); Brown H., Lee K., Mireshghallah F., Shokri R., Tramer F., What does it mean for a language model to preserve privacy, 2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, pp. 2280-2292, (2022); Zaib M., Sheng Q.Z., Emma Zhang W., A short survey of pre-trained language models for conversational ai-a new age in nlp, Proceedings of the Australasian Computer Science Week Multiconference, (2020); Reitmaier T., Wallington E., Kalarikalayil Raju D., Klejch O., Pearson J., Jones M., Bell P., Robinson S., Opportunities and challenges of automatic speech recognition systems for low-resource language speakers, Proceedings of the 2022 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, (2022); Watkins W.M., Chen S.Y.-C., Yoo S., Quantum machine learning with differential privacy, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023); Shaffer D., Chamon C., Hamma A., Mucciolo E.R., Irreversibility and entanglement spectrum statistics in quantum circuits, Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, 2014, 12, (2014); Huck Yang C.-H., Qi J., Chen S.Y.-C., Chen P.-Y., Marco Siniscalchi S., Ma X., Lee C.-H., Decentralizing feature extraction with quantum convolutional neural network for automatic speech recognition, Proc.

This work enhances complex emergency response with machine learning. This study demonstrates its method. This initiative utilizes cutting-edge machine learning and data-driven approaches to speed up and enhance emergency dispatch. Our initial research maximizes emergency resource use. We propose a complex machine learning model that uses current events, geographical characteristics, and historical trends to choose the optimum resources for a circumstance. Reduces reaction times and ensures resources are allocated correctly, improving operational efficiency. Reinforcement learning helps us develop dispatch methods. This helps dispatchers adapt to high-pressure, fast-changing emergencies, boosting their judgment. Using emergency call mood analysis, we may analyze company issues. This helps prioritize and allocate resources. Emergency dispatching improves reaction times, resource utilization, and performance, according to our study. Real-time data analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques let us respond faster to complex emergencies. This enhanced resource allocation. Finally, utilizing cutting-edge machine learning, we found that a paradigm-shifting framework may ease emergency dispatching. Our method can save lives and reduce natural catastrophe damage to communities and people. We anticipate this. Cutting-edge machine learning can improve public health and safety by sending emergency notifications. © 2024 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; Cybersecurity; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing;

This regime consists in the generation of a mode-locked (ML) pulse train under a Q-switched (QS) envelope. In this regard, by properly adjusting the polarization controllers and increasing the pump power in a range from 1 to 3 W, QML regime is obtained. With a maximum pump power of 3 W, a QS pulse duration of 1.46 μs and a pulse energy of 5.96 μJ are obtained. The maximum frequencies reached are 26 kHz and 2.63 MHz, corresponding to the Q-switched and mode-locked pulses, respectively. This method for generating a QML at 2 μm has the advantages of being eye-safe and robust, providing an ideal dual-frequency comb (DFC) generation method with high potential for various applications. © 2023","Fiber laser; Noise-like pulse (NLP); Q-switched mode locking (QML)","Fibers; Group velocity dispersion; Mode-locked fiber lasers; Optical pumping; Polarization; Q switched lasers; Q switching; Thulium; Laser-based; Mode-locked; Noise-like pulse; Nonlinear polarization rotation; Passively Q-switched mode-locked; Q-switched; Q-switched mode locking; Q-switched mode-locking; Switched-mode; Thulium-doped fibers; Fiber lasers","","","","","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT, (CB-287315)","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, project grant CB-287315.

The primary focus of recent research has been to develop algorithms that process natural language in quantum computers, hence the emergence of new sub-domain called QNLP were proposed. Hence the objective of this paper is to provide to NLP researchers a new vision and way to deal with the NLP problems basing on Quantum computing techniques. The present paper aims to provide a list of existing alternatives and classify them by; implementation on classical or quantum hardware, theoretical or experimental work and representation type of sentence.

On the one hand, we have the QC ability to handle complex data more efficiently, taking advantage of the quantum mechanics concepts. On the other hand, ML and FL allow us to express uncertainties by mathematically modeling the imprecision of the natural language. Therefore, we first provide an algebraic model to interpret modal operators on fuzzy logic, and then we represent them in a quantum computing environment. Besides, we present some case studies simulating the fuzzy modal connectives in the Qiskit platform, aiming to better understand the evolution of quantum circuits. © 2024 IEEE.","","Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Quantum electronics; Algebraic interpretations; Algebraic models; Complex data; Computing abilities; Fuzzy-Logic; Modal logic; Natural languages; Quantum Computing; Quantum simulations; Uncertainty; Fuzzy logic","","","","","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (150160/2023-2, 309160/2019-7, 3305805/2021-5); Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul, FAPERGS, (23/2551-0000126-8, 21/ 2551-0002057-1); PRONEX, (16/ 2551-0000488-9)","The authors thanks to Brazilian funding agencies: CAPES, CNPq (309160/2019-7, 3305805/2021-5, 150160/2023-2), PqG/ FAPERGS (21/ 2551-0002057-1), FAPERGS/CNPq (23/2551-0000126-8), and PRONEX (16/ 2551-0000488-9).","Gustafson J.L., Moore's Law, pp. 1177-1184, (2011); Khan A.A., Ahmad A., Waseem M., Liang P., Fahmideh M., Mikkonen T., Abrahamsson P., Software architecture for quantum computing systems-a systematic review, Journal of Systems and Software, 201, (2023); Piattini M., Peterssen G., Perez-Castillo R., Quantum computing: A new software engineering golden age, SIGSOFT Softw.

Graph neural networks are a particular class of machine learning models that have garnered much attention for their ability to deal well with structured data. We investigate how to enhance existing GNNs and find through the inductive bias that quantum circuits are used best to encode node features. The proposed Quantum Feature Embeddings (QFEs) turn raw input features into quantum states, enabling non-linear and entangled representations. In particular, QFEs provide normalized, non-redundant weight matrices in an exponentially larger feature space and require much fewer qubits than fully quantum graph neural networks. On standard graph benchmark datasets, we showcase that for the same parameter count QFEs perform better than their classical counterpart, and are able to match the performance of an exponentially larger model. Finally, we study the potential benefit of using a hybrid quantum graph neural network over a classic alternative on a concrete use case, laser cutting. We find that the proposed model has the performance and thus the near-term potential to uplift these business applications. © 2024 IEEE Computer Society.

Machine learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence which makes computers learn patterns from experiences. Due to the exponential growth of data, machine learning algorithms may be insufficient for big data, whereas on other side quantum computing can do fast computing. A combination of quantum computing and machine learning gave rise to a new field known as quantum machine learning. Quantum machine learning algorithms take advantage of the fast processing of quantum computing and show speedup compared to their classical counterpart. Natural language processing is another area of artificial intelligence that enables the computer to understand human languages. Now, researchers are trying to take advantage of quantum machine learning speedup in natural language processing applications. In this paper, first, we discuss the path from quantum computing to quantum machine learning. Then we review the state of the art of quantum machine learning for natural language processing applications. We also provide classical and quantum-based long short-term memory for parts of speech tagging on social media code mixed language. Our experiment shows that quantum-based long short-term memory performance is better than classical long short-term memory for parts of speech tagging of code-mixed datasets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Natural language processing; POS tagging; Quantum computing; Quantum machine learning","Brain; Codes (symbols); Computational linguistics; Long short-term memory; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Syntactics; Language processing; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural language processing applications; Natural languages; POS tagging; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Learning algorithms","","","","","MeitY Quantum Computing Applications Lab","The work presented here falls under the Research Project Grant Ref.

On the other hand, machine learning has become an essential method for solving many problems such as computer vision, natural language processing, prediction and classification. Quantum machine learning is a new field developed by combining the advantages of these two primary methods. As a hybrid approach to quantum and classical computing, variational quantum circuits are a form of machine learning that allows predicting an output value against input variables. In this study, the effects of superposition and entanglement on weather forecasting, were investigated using a variational quantum circuit model when the dataset size is small. The use of the entanglement layer between the variational layers has made significant improvements on the circuit performance. The use of the superposition layer before the data encoding layer resulted in the use of less variational layers. © Rinton Press.","Hybrid Quantum-Classic Neural Network; Machine Learning; Quantum Computing; Variational Quantum Circuit; Weather Forcasting","Artificial intelligence; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Timing circuits; Weather forecasting; Computer technology; Hybrid quantum-classic neural network; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Quanta computers; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum machines; Variational quantum circuit; Weather forcasting; Learning systems","","","","","","","Nielsen Michael A, Chuang Isaac, Quantum computation and quantum information, (2002); Desurvire Emmanuel, Classical and quantum information theory: an introduction for the telecom scientist, (2009); Deutsch David, Quantum theory, the church-turing principle and the universal quantum com-puter, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Many attempts have been made to develop complete solutions for QA as well as improving significant sub-modules of the QA systems to improve the overall performance through the course of time. Questions are the most important piece of QA, because knowing the question is equivalent to knowing what counts as an answer (Harrah in Philos Sci 28:40–46, 1961, [1]). In this work, we have attempted to understand questions in a better way by using Quantum Machine Learning (QML). The properties of Quantum Computing (QC) have enabled classically intractable data processing. So, in this paper, we have performed question classification on questions from two classes of SelQA (Selection-based Question Answering) dataset using quantum-based classifier algorithms—quantum support vector machine (QSVM) and variational quantum classifier (VQC) from Qiskit (Quantum Information Science toolKIT) for Python. We perform classification with both classifiers in almost similar environments and study the effects of circuit depths while comparing the results of both classifiers. We also use these classification results with our own rule-based QA system and observe significant performance improvement. Hence, this experiment has helped in improving the quality of QA in general. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Quantum computing; Quantum natural language processing; Quantum support vector machines; Question answering; Question classification; Variational quantum classifier","","","","","","","","Harrah D., A logic of questions and answers, Philos.

The evolution of quantum computing hardware and simulators create avenues to design and develop NLP methods to test on these platforms. This research uses quantum natural language processing (QNLP) to simulate the sentence classification and compares optimization techniques (Simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation: SPSA and convergent optimization via most-promising-area stochastic search: COMPASS) for small dataset and simple sentence structures and the results are promising to show that with the COMPASS optimization technique the model performs better Table 1. When the ansatz depth is less and vice-versa. The research in quantum natural language processing is infancy, the simulation results are promising and the better results can be expected for large datasets with different sentence structures if real quantum computers are available in near future. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Binary Classification; COMPASS; DISCOCAT Model; Quantum Computing; Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP); SPSA","Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Optimization; Quantum computers; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Binary classification; COMPASSs; DISCOCAT model; Language processing; Natural languages; Optimization techniques; Quantum Computing; Quantum natural language processing; Sentence classifications; SPSA; Large dataset","","","","","Royal Academy of Science London; Spanish Ministry; Uttar Pradesh; European Commission, EC; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DST; All India Council for Technical Education, अभातशिप; Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnológico Industrial, CDTI; Generalitat de Catalunya","Funding text 1: Dr. Jaume Anguera IEEE Fellow, founder and CTO at the technology company Ignion (Barcelona, Spain).

Every year, more and more software flaws are found, either internally in proprietary code or revealed publicly. These flaws are highly likely exploited and lead to system compromise, data leakage, or denial of service. C and C++ open-source codes are now available in order to create a large-scale, classical machine-learning and quantum machine-learning system for function-level vulnerability identification. We assembled a sizable dataset of millions of open-source functions that point to potential exploits. We created an efficient and scalable vulnerability detection method based on a deep neural network model– Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and quantum machine learning model– Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM), that can learn features extracted from the source codes. The source code is first converted into a minimal intermediate representation to remove the pointless components and shorten the dependency. Previous studies lack analyzing features of the source code that causes models to recognize flaws in real-life examples. Therefore, We keep the semantic and syntactic information using state-of-the-art word embedding algorithms such as Glove and fastText. The embedded vectors are subsequently fed into the classical and quantum convolutional neural networks to classify the possible vulnerabilities. To measure the performance, we used evaluation metrics such as F1 score, precision, recall, accuracy, and total execution time. We made a comparison between the results derived from the classical LSTM and quantum LSTM using basic feature representation as well as semantic and syntactic representation. We found that the QLSTM with semantic and syntactic features detects significantly accurate vulnerability and runs faster than its classical counterpart. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Classical machine learning; Cyber security; Feature extraction; Quantum natural language processing; Vulnerability detection","Brain; Cybersecurity; Deep neural networks; Denial-of-service attack; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Open source software; Open systems; Semantics; Syntactics; Classical machine learning; Cyber security; Features extraction; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Quantum machines; Quantum natural language processing; Source codes; Vulnerability detection; Long short-term memory","","","","","National Science Foundation, NSF, (2100115); National Science Foundation, NSF","Acknowledgement.

Their goal is to improve the performance of current models, and to provide a better representation of several linguistic phenomena, such as ambiguity and long range dependencies. Several families of approaches are presented, including symbolic diagrammatic approaches, and hybrid neural networks. These works show that experimental studies are already feasible, and open research perspectives on the conception of new models and their evaluation. © 2023 Association pour le traitement automatique des langues.

Therefore, a novel end-to-end quantum machine learning approach using multiple data modalities for the identification of diagnoses, prognoses, and effective treatments is proposed. In a procedural flow, data is sourced from one or more of the following: CT scan images, webcam, patient-physician audio, Whole Slide Images, and clinical data. For image data, a Convolutional Neural Network, is employed to detect high level features. With text-based clinical data (including audio-derived data), a Bidirectional Encoder Representation model is used to extract text embeddings. For video data, pupil progression and average fixation duration features are manually crafted. All feature vectors are concatenated, normalized, passed through a Deep Neural Network, and then mapped to one of 38 neurodegenerative and cancerous diseases. For prognosis, features are pooled, concatenated with the diagnosis feature vector, and passed through another neural network with an output of survival times. Treatment prediction involves an information-retrieval task matching feature vectors to treatments/drug lists from the FDA. The proposed approach was tested on 5,000 patient profiles sourced from the public TCGA and JPND databases, outperforming all other state-of-the-art approaches. The model predicted diagnoses with an accuracy of 98.53%, achieved a Concordance Index of 0.94 in predicting prognoses, and in treatment prediction achieved a 99.32% accuracy. © 2022 IEEE.","BERT; diagnosis; Machine Learning; neurodegenerative diseases; pan cancer; prognosis","Computerized tomography; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Learning systems; Medical imaging; BERT; Clinical data; Features vector; Image data; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Multi-modal; Neurodegenerative; Pan cancer; Prognose; Neurodegenerative diseases","","","","","","","(2021); Promoting Cancer Early Diagnosis; Disparities in Access to Cancer Care, American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, (2020); Stanford Health Care, (2014); Brown T., Mann B., Ryder N., Subbiah M., Kaplan J.D., Dhariwal P., Neelakantan A., Et al., Language models are few-shot learners, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, pp. 1877-1901, (2020); Cong I., Et al., Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks, Nature Physics, 15, 12, pp. 1273-1278, (2019); Devlin J., Et al., BERT: Pre-Training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding., (2018); Khattab O., Zaharia M., ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT., (2020); Katzman J.L., Et al., DeepSurv: Personalized Treatment Recommender System Using a Cox Proportional Hazards Deep Neural Network, BMC Medical Research Methodology, 18, 1, (2018); Kingma D.P., Ba J., Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization., (2014); Srivastava N., Et al., Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 15, pp. 1929-1958, (2014); Yao L., Et al., KG-BERT: BERT for Knowledge Graph Completion; Campbell J.D., Et al., Genomic, Pathway Network, and Immunologic Features Distinguishing Squamous Carcinomas, Cell reports, 23, 1, pp. 194-212, (2018); Berg A., Deng J., Fei-Fei L., Large scale visual recognition challenge 2010, (2010); Simard P.Y., Steinkraus D., Platt J.C., Best practices forconvolutional neural networks applied to visual document analysis, Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, 2, pp. 958-962, (2003); Bajaj P., Et al., MS MARCO: A Human Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset., (2018); Boteva V., Gholipour D., Sokolov A., Riezler S., A Full-Text Learning to Rank Dataset for Medical Information Retrieval, Proceedings of the 38th European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR), (2016)","S.

Existing methods mainly combine the dependency tree to deep learning with complex computation time to achieve enough semantic information. It is essential to obtain sufficient semantic information and syntactic structures without any prior knowledge excepting word2vec. This paper proposes a model on sentence representation inspired by quantum entanglement using the tensor product to entangle both two consecutive notional words and words with depen-dencies. Inspired by quantum entanglement coefficients, we construct two different entanglement coefficients to weight the different semantic contributions of words with different relations. Finally, the proposed model is applied to SICK_train to verify their performances. The experimental results show that the provided methods achieve perfect results.  © 2021 IEEE.","Advanced dependencies; Dimensionality reduction; Quantum entanglement coefficient; Sentence similarity; Tensor product","Deep learning; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Semantics; Syntactics; Tensors; Advanced dependency; Complex computation; Dependency trees; Dimensionality reduction; Quantum Computing; Quantum entanglement coefficient; Semantics Information; Sentence similarity; Syntactic structure; Tensor products; Quantum entanglement","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11671001); Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, CUPT, (BYJS201915)","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank the referee for his valuable remarks.

A quantum neural network has been proven to solve the memory bottleneck problem of classical machine learning, so it has far-reaching prospects in the field of vulnerability detection. To fill the gap in this field, we propose a quantum neural network structure named QDENN for software vulnerability detection. This work is the first attempt to implement word embedding of vulnerability codes based on a quantum neural network, which proves the feasibility of a quantum neural network in the field of vulnerability detection. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed QDENN can effectively solve the inconsistent input length problem of quantum neural networks and the problem of batch processing with long sentences. Furthermore, it can give full play to the advantages of quantum computing and realize a vulnerability detection model at the cost of a small amount of measurement. Compared to other quantum neural networks, our proposed QDENN can achieve higher vulnerability detection accuracy. On the sub dataset with a small-scale interval, the model accuracy rate reaches 99%. On each subinterval data, the best average vulnerability detection accuracy of the model reaches 86.3%. © 2022, The Author(s).","","article; embedding; feasibility study; machine learning; software; vulnerability","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61802433, 61802435); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The funding was provided by Natural Science Foundation of China (61802433, 61802435).

Examples of these technologies include: Aerial Data Gathering & Interpretations, Artificial Intelligence including Machine & Deep Learning, Biosciences including DNA Sequencing CRISPR Editing, Blockchain, Micro fluidics, Digital Twin 2.0., Nanotechnology, Natural Language Processing, Quantum Computing, and 3D Printing. The scope of this research will include identification of those disrupting technologies, field level tactical applications of those technologies and use cases, the potential impact of those technologies voted by the 50 operators, and required conditions for top selected technologies to flourish. In this paper we will not review an individual technology to utmost technical depth but we will provide a portfolio view of emerging technologies and their level of impact on the industry. The foresight into the future technological disruptions is critical for the E&P companies who are investing millions of dollars each year in upgrading their equipment and infrastructure. Without this foresight, much of their investments could rapidly become obsolete. Our approach involved deep interviews with subject matter experts within 50 oil companies to collect a database of interests and needs by them. Then we investigated more than 150 technology innovators and startups to identify disruptive solutions that could match those particular needs of the operators. Finally, we brought the top selected technologies in touch with the operators in a one full day workshop to high-grade and discuss the implications. We have reviewed 20 technology trends that have the potential to be disruptive and found out that 5 of these technology trends attracted and were viewed as top areas for disruption by 80% of the operators. We also found out that a few of these technology themes are more fundamental and the enablers for the broader set of disruptions to happen, while a number of them are more secondary or consequential. Up to this date all research on frontier technologies that could have an impact on oil and gas industry have been studied academically and/or by industry on a one by one basis. This paper for the first time collects a statistically valid interpretation on the importance of these technologies by the resource holders themselves and takes a portfolio view on emerging technologies versus the silo view that makes it difficult to prioritize resources and technology roadmaps. This will benefit all stakeholders of the oil and gas industry ranging from operators, innovators, investors, and to the resource holder nations in large. © Copyright 2019, Offshore Technology Conference","","3D printers; Antennas; Deep learning; Digital twin; DNA sequences; Engineering education; Fluidics; Gas industry; Gene encoding; Investments; Natural language processing systems; Offshore oil well production; Quantum computers; Disruptive technology; Emerging technologies; Individual technology; NAtural language processing; Oil and Gas Industry; Subject matter experts; Technology roadmaps; Technology trends; Offshore technology","","","","","","","","","","Offshore Technology Conference","","Offshore Technology Conference Brasil 2019, OTCB 2019","29 October 2019 through 31 October 2019","Rio de Janeiro","157170","","978-161399671-3","","","English","Offshore Technol.

However, extracting accurate noise spectra from typical time-dynamics measurements on qubits is intractable using standard methods. Here, we propose to address this challenge using deep-learning algorithms, leveraging the remarkable progress made in the field of image recognition, natural language processing, and more recently, structured data. We demonstrate a neural-network-based methodology that allows for extraction of the noise spectrum associated with any qubit surrounded by an arbitrary bath, with significantly greater accuracy than the current methods of choice. The technique requires only a two-pulse echo decay curve as input data and can further be extended either for constructing customized optimal dynamical decoupling protocols or for obtaining critical qubit attributes such as its proximity to the sample surface. Our results can be applied to a wide range of qubit platforms, and provide a framework for improving qubit performance with applications not only in quantum computing and nanoscale sensing but also in material characterization techniques such as magnetic resonance. © 2021 authors.

This work covers study and implementation of two approaches for developing a credit card fraud detection model. First one, with hybrid quantum neural networks. In recent times, Quantum Computers (QC) are making their footprints into AI/ML domain. Quantum neural networks (QNN) hybrid with classical neural net has been used in various tasks such as - natural language processing, image processing etc. The second approach is with Topological Data Analysis (TDA). Finding topological structure in the input data also become relevant from the perspective of noise reduction. The visualization capabilities of TDA can become an aid in classification of credit card fraud as well. TDA is implemented with mapper based method here. In hybrid QNN, we are covering a reference implementation of Xanadu's StrawberryFields, where a classical network processes the input to be fed into a QNN model. Although technique wise these two approaches are drastically different, for the sake of generalization we implement TDA and hybrid QNN with a publicly available credit card fraud detection dataset. We tested with balanced fraud and genuine features and hybrid QNN model provides accuracy of 89.5%, whereas TDA mapper with our novel approach of classification provides an accuracy of 94%. © 2021 IEEE.","Classification; Fraud Detection; QML; QNN; StrawberryFields; TDA Mapper","Crime; Image processing; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Topology; Credit card fraud detections; Credit cards; Financial transactions; Fraud detection; Neural network model; QML; Quantum neural networks; Strawberryfield; Topological data analyse mapper; Topological data analysis; Noise abatement","","","","","","","Killoran N., Bromley T.R., Arrazola J.M., Schuld M., Quesada N., Lloyd S., Continuous-variable quantum neural networks, Phys.

Few approach look for providing a solution over existing big data processing platform which usually runs over a large scale commodity cpu cluster. As training deep learning workload require many small computations to be done and large communication to pass the data between layers, General Purpose GPUs seems to the best platforms to train these networks. Different approaches have been proposed to scale processing on cluster of GPU servers. We have summarized various approaches used in this regard. © 2016 IEEE.","big data; deep learning; deep neural network; neuromorphic machines; quantum computing","Data handling; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Image processing; Natural language processing systems; Program processors; Quantum computers; Speech recognition; General-purpose GPUs; Large amounts; Learning techniques; NAtural language processing; Neuromorphic; Quantum Computing; State of the art; State-of-the-art approach; Big data","","","","","","","Pastur-Romay L.A., Cedron F., Pazos A., Porto-Pazos A.B., Deep artificial neural networks and neuromorphic chips for big data analysis: Pharmaceutical and bioinformatics applications, Int.

The language-modelling framework we employ is that of compositional distributional semantics (DisCoCat), which extends and complements the compositional structure of pregroup grammars. Within this model, the grammatical reduction of a sentence is interpreted as a diagram, encoding a specific interaction of words according to the grammar. It is this interaction which, together with a specific choice of word embedding, realises the meaning (or”semantics”) of a sentence. Building on the formal quantum-like nature of such interactions, we present a method for mapping DisCoCat diagrams to quantum circuits. Our methodology is compatible both with NISQ devices and with established Quantum Machine Learning techniques, paving the way to near-term applications of quantum technology to natural language processing. © K.

The authors of the paper proposed a new quantum-like method for classifying short texts. The basis of the method is the representation of the text as an ensemble of elementary particles. The value of the detection probability amplitude of a given ensemble at the selected points in space is chosen as a classification criterion. In this case, the space is understood as a vector space described using the distributive-semantic model of the language. The authors suggested one of the possible ways of interpreting the parameters of the wave function that describes the behavior of an elementary particle, as well as an algorithm for calculating the probability amplitude taking into account these parameters. For the experimental research of the described method, authors performed the classification of Internet communities by topics. For the analysis, the names and the “information” section of communities were used. In total, 100 groups of the social network “VKontakte” belonging to five various topics were taken. The proposed model showed rather high classification accuracy (91 % in general on the data set and from 75 % to 95 % within individual classes). The proposed model is supposed to be used to classify user comments about goods, services and events, as well as to determine some properties of the psychological portraits of users of online communities. © 2022, ITMO University.

They, nonetheless, pose a key challenge to the development of competent machines to understand natural language and use it as humans do. Contextuality is an unparalleled phenomenon in quantum mechanics, where different mathematical formalisms have been put forwards to understand and reason about it. In this paper, we construct a schema for anaphoric ambiguities that exhibits quantum-like contextuality. We use a recently developed criterion of sheaf-theoretic contextuality that is applicable to signalling models. We then take advantage of the neural word embedding engine BERT to instantiate the schema to natural language examples and extract probability distributions for the instances. As a result, plenty of sheaf-contextual examples were discovered in the natural language corpora BERT utilises. Our hope is that these examples will pave the way for future research and for finding ways to extend applications of quantum computing to natural language processing. © K. I. Lo, M. Sadrzadeh & S.

But the gap between theory and hardware is closing, assisted by developments in quantum algorithmic modeling. One such recent development is Quan-tumCircuitOpt (QCOpt), an open-source software framework that leverages state-of-the-art optimization-based solvers to find provably optimal compact circuit decompositions, which are exact up to global phase and machine precision. The quantum circuit design problem can be modeled using non-linear, non-convex constraints. However, QCOpt reformulates these non-linear constraints using well-known linearization techniques such that the resulting design problem is solved as a mixed-integer linear programming model. In this work, we instead explore whether the QCOpt's model could also be effective with a continuous Non-Linear Programming (NLP) model obtained via relaxation of the integer variables in the non-linear constraints.

Furthermore, the processing of classical data and machine learning algorithms in the quantum domain has given rise to an emerging field like quantum machine learning. Recently, quantum machine learning has become quite a challenging field in the case of healthcare applications. As a result, quantum machine learning has become a common and effective technique for data processing and classification across a wide range of domains. Consequently, quantum machine learning is the most commonly used application of quantum computing. The main objective of this work is to present a brief overview of current state-of-the-art published articles between 2013 and 2021 to identify, analyze, and classify the different QML algorithms and applications in the biomedical field. Furthermore, the approach adheres to the requirements for conducting systematic literature review techniques such as research questions and quality metrics of the articles. Initially, we discovered 3149 articles, excluded the 2847 papers, and read the 121 full papers. Therefore, this research compiled 30 articles that comply with the quantum machine learning models and quantum circuits using biomedical data. Eventually, this article provides a broad overview of quantum machine learning limitations and future prospects.  © 2013 IEEE.","biomedical and healthcare; Quantum computing; quantum machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Bioinformatics; Classification (of information); Computational chemistry; Data handling; Diagnosis; Health care; Learning systems; Medical applications; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Biomedical and healthcare; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Medical diagnostic imaging; Medical services; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Systematic; Learning algorithms","","","","","Eusko Jaurlaritza, (IT-1536-22); Eusko Jaurlaritza","This work was supported by the eVIDA Research Group, University of Deusto, Bilbao, Spain, through the Basque Government, under Grant IT-1536-22.","Ciliberto C., Herbster M., Ialongo A.D., Pontil M., Rocchetto A., Severini S., Wossnig L., Quantum machine learning: A classical perspective, Proc.

Since the automatic verification of social media postings has shown to be challenging, there exists the need of classification systems, that can identify check-worthy posts in social media feeds. In this paper, the classification system used in the CLEF2022-CheckThat! Lab to detect check-worthiness in English tweets is presented. The proposed system, that took advantage of ensemble and semi-supervised learning showed promising results in the experimental evaluation. Further, first experiments were conducted with the novel framework lambeq to solve the classification problem using quantum natural language processing (QNLP), which were not part of the final model.

Many of the Grand Challenges facing the simulation community will further stress the concerned computer resources. These computer/human interfaces are currently being enhanced and will require both technical advances and societal changes. This paper offers a list of Virtual Human Grand Challenges, solicited from leaders in the community, for purposes of this discussion. Then the authors report on emerging technologies that will further enhance the “human” qualities of the previously mentioned interfaces. Some of these technologies are hardware based while others come from software developments. Further, system engineering advances are presented with the intention of making better use of all the aspects of the system to achieve simulation goals. On the hardware side, there is the emerging technology comprised of several threads of quantum computing, e.g. USC's 2,000 Qubit Quantum Annealer. Software advances of note are discussed in the areas of voice recognition, natural language processing, and deep learning. The use of quantum annealing to enhance deep learning is particularly examined. Systems engineering issues are analyzed, as these emerging technologies do not stand alone and must be integrated into or replace legacy systems, mandating close adherence to a range of standards. In each of these cases, the authors discuss theirs and others' experience with the technologies and explicate both the benefits and the costs of such implementations. The paper is written so as to assist the researcher and the systems implementers in choosing which of the new technologies warrants consideration for inclusion in their own work and which technologies will eventually require adoption in order to stay compatible with other systems. Other technologies may require more effort in implementation than they would provide utility in practice. © 2018 Fall Simulation Innovation Workshop: Leveraging the Power of Simulation, SIW 2018.

The main challenges consist in finding the most adequate ways of encoding words and their interactions on a quantum computer, considering hardware constraints, as well as building algorithms that take advantage of quantum architectures, so as to show improvement on the performance of natural language tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that starts from a grammar that can be interpreted by means of tensor contraction, to build word representations as quantum states that serve as input to a quantum algorithm. We start by introducing an operator measurement to contract the representations of words, resulting in the representation of larger fragments of text. We then go on to develop pipelines for the tasks of sentence meaning disambiguation and question answering that take advantage of quantum features. For the first task, we show that our contraction scheme deals with syntactically ambiguous phrases storing the various different meanings in quantum superposition, a solution not available on a classical setting. For the second task, we obtain a question representation that contains all possible answers in equal quantum superposition, and we implement Grover’s quantum search algorithm to find the correct answer, agnostic to the specific question, an implementation with the potential of delivering a result with quadratic speedup. © 2022, The Author(s).","Grover’s algorithm; Quantum natural language processing; Quantum search; Question answering; Syntactic ambiguities","Computer hardware; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Text processing; Automatic text processing; Grov’s algorithm; Hardware constraints; Quanta computers; Quantum natural language processing; Quantum search; Quantum superpositions; Question Answering; S-algorithms; Syntactic Ambiguities; Natural language processing systems","","","","","Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO; Ministerie van Onderwijs, Cultuur en Wetenschap, OCW; Universiteit Utrecht, UU","We would like to thank the anonymous referees for the helpful comments.

The QML emission is obtained in a cavity with net anomalous dispersion in a pump power interval in between the CW laser threshold and the threshold of the NLP regime. Highest-energy QML pulses were observed with a repetition rate of 812 kHz with a pump power of 520 mW at the optical wavelength of 1881.09 nm. A maximum overall energy of 460 nJ at an average output power of 6.4 mW was reached, which corresponds to a burst of mode-locked noise-like sub-pulses with 8.7 ns of pulse duration within a QML envelope of 11 µs. These results demonstrate unconventional pulse operation regime of NLPs and provide insights into the dynamics of mode-locked fiber lasers. © 2021 The Author(s)","Nonlinear polarization rotation; Q-switched mode locking; Thulium-doped fiber lasers","","","","","","FAI-UASLP, (C20-FAI-10-28.28); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT, (217560); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT","This work was supported by CONACyT “Ciencia de Frontera 2019” under Grant 217560 and FAI-UASLP project C20-FAI-10-28.28.","Ahmad H., Samion M.Z., Yusoff N., Soliton mode-locked thulium-doped fiber laser with cobalt oxide saturable absorber, Opt.

The KNN algorithm is a widely used text classification algorithm, because it is simple, valid and non-parameters. The main idea of KNN algorithm is to calculate the similarity between the new sample with unknown class label and the training samples, and choosing the class label of the highest k nearest neighbors as the new sample's class label. However, the text contains hundreds and thousands of features. The similarity computing in large numbers of vector will cost many time. In fact that, many machine learning algorithms are unable to manipulate and compute large number of vectors in high-dimensional space. Quantum computing algorithms are good at computing high-dimensional vectors in large tensor product spaces. It can provide exponential speed-up over its classical counterparts. The N-dimensional quantum vectors represent 2N quantum superposition states. The similarity computing on the N-dimensional vectors is also on the 2N quantum superposition states simultaneously. Therefore, this paper introduces a KNN algorithms based on quantum computing, which uses fidelity to compute the similarity between two quantum states. The Control-Swap Test gate is very convenient as a fidelity estimator. © 2015 IEEE.","KNN; machine learning; Quantum information; text classification","Character recognition; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Text processing; Vector spaces; Vectors; Classical counterpart; Dimensional vectors; High dimensional spaces; K-nearest neighbors; Quantum Information; Quantum superposition state; Similarity computing; Text classification; Classification (of information)","","","","","","","Esma A., Gilles B., Sebastien G., Machine Learning in A Quantum World, pp. 431-442, (2006); Nathan W., Ashish K., Krysta M.S., Quantum Algorithms for Nearest-Neighbor Methods for Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, (2014); Feynman R.P., Simulating physics with computers, International Journal of Theoretical Physics, 21, 6-7, pp. 467-488, (1982); Grover L.K., Quantum mechanism helps in searching for a needle in a haystack, Physical Revies Letters, 79, pp. 325-328, (1997); Shor P.W., Polynomial-Time algorithm for prime factorization and discrete logarithms on a quantum computer, SIAM Journal on Computation, 26, 5, pp. 1484-1509, (1997); Cai X.D., Wu D., Su Z.E., Et al., Entanglement-Based Machine Learning on A Quantum Computer, (2015); Seth L., Masoud M., Patrick R., Quantum Algorithm for Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning, (2013); Peishu X., Quantum computing, Journal of Computer Research & Development, 38, 10, pp. 1153-1171, (2001); Lijuan G., Xingyi L., Improvements of KNN algorithm for Big Data Classification, Applicatiion Research of Computers, 31, 5, pp. 1342-1344, (2014); Paul I.H., Ioannis G.K., Quantum Computers: Registers, gates and algorithms, Proc. 28th International Conference on Microelectronics (MIEL), 2012, pp. 15-21, (2012); Kristen L.P., Daniel A.L., Quantum Adiabatic Machine Learning, (2011); Yi Z., Kai L., Yinghui G., Quantum algorithms and Quantum-Inspired algorithms, Chinese Journal of Computers, 36, 9, pp. 1835-1842, (2013); Shuhao W., Guilu L., Big data and quantum computing, Computer China Press, 60, 56, pp. 499-508, (2015); Patrick R., Masoud M., Seth L., Quantum Support Vector Machine for Big Feature and Big Data Classification, (2013)","","Xiao Z.; Tong Z.; Li K.; Wang X.; Li K.","IEEE Computer Society","","11th International Conference on Natural Computation, ICNC 2015","15 August 2015 through 17 August 2015","Zhangjiajie","118970","21579555","978-146737679-2","","","English","Proc.

We studied the performance of the two most popular optimizers and compared their results with some popular classical machine learning algorithms. The classical algorithms we used in our study are support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting (GB) and random forest (RF). These were compared with a variational quantum classifier (VQC) using two sets of local optimizers viz AQGD and COBYLA. For experimenting with VQC, IBM Quantum Experience and IBM Qiskit was used while for classical machine learning models, scikit-learn was used. The results show that machine learning on noisy immediate scale quantum machines can produce comparable results as on classical machines. For our experiments, we have used a popular restaurant sentiment analysis dataset. The extracted features from this dataset and then after applying PCA reduced the feature set into 5 features. Quantum ML models were trained using 100 epochs and 150 epochs on using EfficientSU2 variational circuit. Overall, four Quantum ML models were trained and three Classical ML models were trained. The performance of the trained models was evaluated using standard evaluation measures viz, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-Score. In all the cases AQGD optimizer-based model with 100 Epochs performed better than all other models. It produced an accuracy of 77% and an F-Score of 0.785 which were highest across all the trained models.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Decision trees; Intelligent computing; Learning algorithms; Sentiment analysis; Support vector machines; F-score; Feature sets; Gradient boosting; Local optimizers; Machine learning models; Optimizers; Quantum machines; Standard evaluations; Learning systems","","","","","","","Aiimeur E., Brassard G., Gambs S., In Conference of the Canadian Society for Computational Studies of Intelligence, (2006); Kak S.

It has been particularly successful in quantum computing and natural language processing recently; traditionally, it has played major rôles in compositional semantics of programming languages and symbolic reasoning systems. Building upon them, we propose the mathematical system of neural string diagrams as a universal modelling language for categorical deep learning, which allows us to turn informal neural network architecture pictures into formally explainable, mathematically verifiable, and systematically composable entities in their own right. We give, in particular, a neural string diagram account of CNN and Transformer (which has never been achieved before). Neural string diagrams can be computed with DisCoPy, Quantomatic, and their extensions. Categorically formalised neural networks can be instantiated for both ordinary vector spaces and other monoidal categorical structures, allowing for generalisations of deep learning (e.g., deep learning on relational structures, deep learning on graph and other network structures, etc.). We envisage that the category theory approach to artificial intelligence ultimately contributes to the development of artificial general intelligence, giving a universal modelling language for intelligent systems and agents. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Categorical artificial intelligence; Categorical deep learning; Neural category theory","Computation theory; Deep learning; Intelligent systems; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Quantum computers; Vector spaces; Categorical artificial intelligence; Categorical deep learning; Category theory; Compositional models; Computational system; Logical physicals; Logical system; Neural category theory; Physical systems; Universal modeling languages; Semantics","","","","","Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST, (JPMJMS2033, JPMJPR17G9)","This work was supported by JST (JPMJMS2033; JPMJPR17G9).","Abramsky S., Coecke B., Categorical quantum mechanics, Handbook of Quantum Logic and Quantum Structures, pp. 261-325, (2009); Besold T., Et al., Neural-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning, (2017); Clark S., Et al., Mathematical foundations for a compositional distributional model of meaning, Linguist.

We systematically analyze RNNs' behaviors in a ubiquitous NLP task, the sentiment analysis of movie reviews, via the mapping between a class of RNNs called recurrent arithmetic circuits (RACs) and a matrix product state. Using the von-Neumann entanglement entropy (EE) as a proxy for information propagation, we show that single-layer RACs possess a maximum information propagation capacity, reflected by the saturation of the EE. Enlarging the bond dimension beyond the EE saturation threshold does not increase model prediction accuracies, so a minimal model that best estimates the data statistics can be inferred. Although the saturated EE is smaller than the maximum EE allowed by the area law, our minimal model still achieves 1/499% training accuracies in realistic sentiment analysis data sets. Thus, low EE is not a warrant against the adoption of single-layer RACs for NLP. Contrary to a common belief that long-range information propagation is the main source of RNNs' successes, we show that single-layer RACs harness high expressiveness from the subtle interplay between the information propagation and the word vector embeddings. Our work sheds light on the phenomenology of learning in RACs, and more generally on the explainability of RNNs for NLP, using tools from many-body quantum physics.  © 2022 The Author(s).

We are interested in further advancing this field, focusing on composition. In contrast to current ‘black-box’ AI methods, we are championing an interpretable compositional outlook on generative music systems. In particular, we are importing methods from the Distributional Compositional Categorical (DisCoCat) modelling framework for Natural Language Processing (NLP), motivated by musical grammars. Quantum computing is a nascent technology, which is very likely to impact the music industry in time to come. Thus, we are championing a Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) approach to develop a new generation of intelligent musical systems. This work follows previous experimental implementations of DisCoCat linguistic models on quantum hardware. In this chapter, we present Quanthoven, the first proof-of-concept ever built, which (a) demonstrates that it is possible to program a quantum computer to learn to classify music that conveys different meanings and (b) illustrates how such a capability might be leveraged to develop a system to compose meaningful pieces of music. After a discussion about our current understanding of music as a communication medium and its relationship to natural language, the chapter focuses on the techniques developed to (a) encode musical compositions as quantum circuits, and (b) design a quantum classifier. The chapter ends with demonstrations of compositions created with the system. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","","","","","","","","","Abramsky S., Coecke B., Categorical quantum mechanics, Handbook of quantum logic and quantum structures, (2008);

In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical model of LSTM, which we dub QLSTM. We demonstrate that the proposed model successfully learns several kinds of temporal data. In particular, we show that for certain testing cases, this quantum version of LSTM converges faster, or equivalently, reaches a better accuracy, than its classical counterpart. Due to the variational nature of our approach, the requirements on qubit counts and circuit depth are eased, and our work thus paves the way toward implementing machine learning algorithms for sequence modeling such as natural language processing, speech recognition on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. © 2022 IEEE","Long short-term memory;

Here, popular machine learning algorithms viz support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting (GB) and random forest (RF) are compared with variational quantum classifier (VQC) using two sets of parameterized circuits viz EfficientSU2 and RealAmplitudes. For experimenting with VQC, IBM Quantum Experience and IBM Qiskit were used while for classical machine learning models, scikit-learn was used. It was found that the performance of the VQC was slightly better than popular machine learning algorithms. For our experiments, we have used popular restaurant sentiment analysis dataset. The extracted features from this dataset and then after applying PCA reduced the feature set into 5 features. Quantum ML models were trained using 100 epochs and 150 epochs. Overall, four Quantum ML models were trained and three Classical ML models were trained. The performance of the trained models was evaluated using standard evaluation measures viz, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-Score etc. In all the cases EfficientSU2 based model with 100 Epochs performed better than all other models. Efficient SU2 model with 100 epochs produced an accuracy of 74.5% and an F-Score of 0.7605 which were highest across all the trained models. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Sentiment analysis; Support vector machines; Timing circuits; F-score; Feature sets; Gradient boosting; Machine learning models; Parameterized; Quantum machines; Standard evaluations; Learning systems","","","","","","","Kak S.

A discrete sequence of words can be much more easily integrated with downstream neural layers if it is represented as a sequence of continuous vectors. Also, semantic relationships between words, learned from a text corpus, can be encoded in the relative configurations of the embedding vectors. However, storing and accessing embedding vectors for all words in a dictionary requires large amount of space, and may strain systems with limited GPU memory. Here, we used approaches inspired by quantum computing to propose two related methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, for storing word embedding matrix during training and inference in a highly efficient way. Our approach achieves a hundred-fold or more reduction in the space required to store the embeddings with almost no relative drop in accuracy in practical natural language processing tasks. © 2020 8th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2020.

However, most sentiments and emotions are temporal and often exist in a complex manner. Several emotions can be experienced at the same time. Instead of recognizing only categorical information about emotions, there is a need to understand and quantify the intensity of emotions. The proposed research intends to investigate a quantum-inspired approach for quantifying emotional intensities in runtime. The inspiration comes from manifesting human cognition and decision-making capabilities, which may adopt a brief explanation through quantum theory. Quantum state fidelity was used to characterize states and estimate emotion intensities rendered by subjects from the Amsterdam Dynamic Facial Expression Set (ADFES) dataset. The Quantum variational classifier technique was used to perform this experiment on the IBM Quantum Experience platform. The proposed method successfully quantifies the intensities of joy, sadness, contempt, anger, surprise, and fear emotions of labelled subjects from the ADFES dataset.  © 2013 IEEE.","Emotion detection; quantification of emotions; quantum computation; quantum machine learning; sentiment analysis","Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Data mining; Decision making; Decision theory; Emotion Recognition; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Quantum computers; Variational techniques; Classification algorithm; Computational modelling; Emotion detection; Emotion recognition; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Quantification of emotion; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Sentiment analysis; Semantics","","","","","Cluster of Zayed University, (R20143); Kean University; Office of Research and Sponsored Programs, Marquette University","This work was supported in part by the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs, Kean University; and in part by the Cluster of Zayed University, United Arab Emirates, under Grant R20143.","Singh J., Goyal G., Gupta S., FADU-EV an automated framework for pre-release emotive analysis of theatrical trailers, Multimedia Tools Appl., 78, 6, pp. 7207-7224, (2019); Chang W.-Y., Chen C.-S., Hung Y.-P., Analyzing facial expression by fusing manifolds, Computer Vision_ACCV 2007, pp. 621-630, (2007); Chang K.-Y., Chen C.-S., Hung Y.-P., Intensity rank estimation of facial expressions based on a single image, Proc.

QML-NLP pulses were obtained at 812 kHz repetition rate within a 11 μs QML envelope and pulse energy of 460 nJ. Central modelocked NLP sub-pulses were measured with 8.71 ns of width and 4.17 of peak power. The evolution of QML-NLP is experimentally investigated, and the results demonstrate the feasibility of an unconventional pulse operation regime of NLPs and provide insights into the dynamics of mode-locked fiber lasers.

Meanwhile, rapid progress has been made in the field of quantum computation including developing both powerful quantum algorithms and advanced quantum devices. The interplay between machine learning and quantum physics holds the intriguing potential for bringing practical applications to the modern society. Here, we focus on quantum neural networks in the form of parameterized quantum circuits. We will mainly discuss different structures and encoding strategies of quantum neural networks for supervised learning tasks, and benchmark their performance utilizing Yao.jl, a quantum simulation package written in Julia Language.

Category theory today is arguably foundations of science as well as foundations of mathematics. Yet applications of category theory to the life sciences are still limited, and there are seemingly no clearly successful paradigmatic cases of them. Here we address foundational aspects of category theory in and across the sciences, and potential structural interconnections between category theory and the life sciences, in particular cognitive science. More specifically, we first address the two aspects of category theory as foundations of science and as foundations of mathematics in particular, and then discuss what category theory could do for foundations of life science, in particular cognitive science. We propose, amongst other things, a categorical structuralist approach to the mind-body problem as an alternative to reductionist approaches, which is arguably of both scientific and metaphysical significance at the same time. Category theory allows us to elucidate structural interconnections between the laws of cognition and the laws of reality, thus paving the way for overcoming the Cartesian dualism separating the cognitive and physical worlds. Put another way, category theory suggests that there may be higher laws governing both worlds at once; the higher structuralist theory of cognition may embody the double aspect theory of information by David Chalmers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Category theory; Cognitive science; Life sciences; Penrose; Quantum theory","Biological Science Disciplines; Cognition; Cognitive Science; Humans; Logic; Mathematics; Mind-Body Relations, Metaphysical; Models, Theoretical; Physics; cognition; life science; mathematics; quantitative analysis; article; biomedicine; cognition; human; human experiment; mathematics; psychology; quantum theory; alternative medicine; biomedicine; cognition; logic; mathematics; physics; theoretical model","","","","","Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology, PRESTO, (JPMJPR17G9); Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology, PRESTO","This work was supported by JST PRESTO (JPMJPR17G9), and the author would like to thank the members of its quantum life science domain for fruitful discussions and comments.

In this paper we study a quantum reservoir computer (QRC), a framework harnessing quantum dynamics and designed for fast and efficient solving of temporal machine learning tasks such as speech recognition, time series prediction and natural language processing. Specifically, we study memory capacity and accuracy of a quantum reservoir computer based on the fully connected transverse field Ising model by investigating different forms of inter-spin interactions and computing timescales. We show that variation in inter-spin interactions leads to a better memory capacity in general, by engineering the type of interactions the capacity can be greatly enhanced and there exists an optimal timescale at which the capacity is maximized. To connect computational capabilities to physical properties of the underlaying system, we also study the out-of-time-ordered correlator and find that its faster decay implies a more accurate memory. Furthermore, as an example application on real world data, we use QRC to predict stock values. © 2020, The Author(s).","","article; human; machine learning; memory; natural language processing; prediction; speech discrimination; time series analysis","","","","","Jenny ja Antti Wihurin Rahasto; Council of Finnish Foundations; Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology, PRESTO, (JPMJPR1668); Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology, PRESTO; Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, CREST, (JPMJCR1673); Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, CREST; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (19H05796, JP16H02211); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN; Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology, ERATO, (JPMJER1601); Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology, ERATO","A.K. is supported by Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation through Council of Finnish Foundations\u2019 Post Doc Pool, T.S. by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP16H02211 and JP19H05796, and K.F. by JST PRESTO Grant Number JPMJPR1668, JST ERATO Grant Number JPMJER1601, and JST CREST Grant Number JPMJCR1673.

This assumption is at the basis of our study. The tools are 1) identifying new parameters for the production of fixed structures identified in the Planat model mathematical theories; 2) using Charles Baudelaire’s narrative text [3] to clarify the importance of the verb in the sentence through the research and experimentation method into a local grammar; 3) utilizing Max Silberztein's NooJ system [4], for the production of sentence analysis and paraphrases, tools for developing formal dictionaries and grammars, and NLP applications such as semantic annotators; 4) developing the implementation of advanced integrated Machine Learning algorithms for the creation of knowledge from obtained data; 5) applying the BuViTeMS (© 2020) AW Digital Intelligence model for the production of edited, reformulated and translated sentences using a mixed system.

Its deployment of neural networks serves as an alternative for mitigating the rapidly increased demand for computing resources in electronic platforms. However, it remains a formidable challenge to train the online programmable optical neural networks efficiently, being restricted by the difficulty in obtaining gradient information on a physical device when executing a gradient descent algorithm. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an efficient, physics-agnostic, and closed-loop protocol for training optical neural networks on chip. A gradient-free algorithm, that is, the genetic algorithm, is adopted. The protocol is on-chip implementable, physical agnostic (no need to rely on characterization and offline modeling), and gradient-free. The protocol works for various types of chip structures and is especially helpful to those that cannot be analytically decomposed and characterized. We confirm its viability using several practical tasks, including the crossbar switch and the Iris classification. Finally, by comparing our physics-agonistic and gradient-free method to the off-chip and gradient-based training methods, we demonstrate the robustness of our system to perturbations such as imperfect phase implementation and photodetection noise. Optical processors with gradient-free genetic algorithms have broad application potentials in pattern recognition, reinforcement learning, quantum computing, and realistic applications (such as facial recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles).  © ","deep learning, optical computing; genetic algorithm; gradient-free; on-chip training; optical neural networks","Face recognition; Genetic algorithms; Gradient methods; Natural language processing systems; Network-on-chip; Optical data processing; Quantum computers; Reinforcement learning; Silicon photonics; Electronic platforms; Facial recognition; Gradient descent algorithms; Gradient informations; Iris classifications; NAtural language processing; Optical neural networks; Realistic applications; Neural networks","","","","","National Research Foundation Singapore, NRF; Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE, (MOE2017-T3-1-001); Ministry of Education - Singapore, MOE; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (NRF-CRP13-2014-01, NRF-NRFF2016-02, NRF2017NRF-NSFC002-014); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) Tier 3 Grant (MOE2017-T3-1-001), the Singapore National Research Foundation (NRF) National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Joint Grant (NRF2017NRF-NSFC002-014), the Singapore National Research Foundation under the Competitive Research Program (NRF-CRP13-2014-01), and the NRF Fellowship Reference No. NRF-NRFF2016-02.","Miller D.A., Silicon photonics: Meshing optics with applications, Nat.

This rapid transformation to a new digital age in medicine promises new approaches to clinical diagnosis, prediction, decision-making, personalised healthcare and remote patient monitoring. In this chapter, we describe some of the history behind ML in healthcare and review the ML-Big Data nexus, the taxonomy of ML (supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement Learning), the fundamental differences between the fields of statistics and ML, the usual workflow used to develop and validate ML algorithms and how the predictive accuracy of ML algorithms is evaluated. We also discuss the barriers towards the implementation of ML algorithms for clinical decision support within healthcare including ethical considerations, data governance and security, clinician and patient confidence, transparency, data bias, as well as the issues preventing a more rapid integration of AI into healthcare. Finally, we describe some of the more recent developments of ML in healthcare, including quantum ML, federated learning, automated ML, natural language processing and the new progress made in precision medicine via a renewed focus on using reinforcement learning. Throughout the text, we try as far as possible to map the various algorithms and architectures of ML to research questions and healthcare applications with a focus on the older patient population. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Automated machine learning; Big Data; Clinical decision support; Data mining; Explainable AI; Federated learning; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Precision medicine; Reinforcement learning; Risk prediction","","","","","","","","Jayaraman P.P., Forkan A.R.M., Morshed A., Haghighi P.D., Kang Y.-B., Healthcare 4.0: A review of frontiers in digital health.

Researchers have formulated and executed a plethora of bug forecasting methodologies by computing the performance in terms of precision and difficulty. Various statistical models are established in the literature to observe bug existence and restoring method; these models are termed software reliability growth models. The existence of bugs in software is primarily because of the constant variations in the software code. Open source software is prevalent amongst academicians and has found users in big businesses. OSS is extremely effective, but source code variations have to be made regularly through the progressively advanced requirement at the user’s end. The open source group is expanding rapidly, and numerous categories of provisions are offered. Stakeholders contribute to OSS in business by reinforcing the value of schemes, taking into account great revenue earnings and novel scheme expansion. An essential feature of open source software is determining when to issue a novel form. The principal goal is to announce the software at a suitable time with minimal economic restrictions. The approach after announcing software is a challenge and announcement development performs a vital function in handling effective announcements to clients. It is essentially a group of novel characteristics that are combined to form an invention setting. The primary announcement is just after the expansion procedure and additional consequent announcements are founded upon the preceding announcements, number of prerequisites, and faults restored. Each announcement incorporates a collection of characteristics fulfilling particular restrictions of the corporation as required by the customers. Forming conclusions about what characteristics are to be encompassed in which announcement is a tiresome job. Information theory, which deals with computation and communication of knowledge around a network, was primarily invented by Claude E Shannon. It is a probabilistic established method that emphasizes the computation of vagueness associating data. It has widespread prospective functions in areas including model recognition, statistical interpretation, natural language processing, thermal physics, quantum computing, etc. Entropy is a significant subdivision of information theory that performs a principal function in examining the code change procedure. It is a quantity of uncertainty/difficulty of code change and portrays the quantity of information covered in an event. In this chapter, a method of captivating the number of faults documented in numerous announcements of Bugzilla software is established and distinctive amounts of entropy for the alterations in various software, which informs these intervals, are computed. Initially simple linear regression is employed to envisage faults that are expected to occur in the future. By means of anticipated faults and entropy measures in multiple linear regression, the announcement period of the software has been forecast. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The use of quantum systems to process classical data using machine learning algorithms has given rise to an emerging research area, i.e. quantum machine learning. Despite its origins in the processing of classical data, quantum machine learning also explores the use of quantum phenomena for learning systems, the use of quantum computers for learning on quantum data and how machine learning algorithms and software can be formulated and implemented on quantum computers. Quantum machine learning can have a transformational effect on computer science. It may speed up the processing of information well beyond the existing classical speeds. Recent work has seen the development of quantum algorithms that could serve as foundations for machine learning applications. Despite its great promise, there are still significant hardware and software challenges that need to be resolved before quantum machine learning becomes practical. In this paper, we present an overview of quantum machine learning in the light of classical approaches. Departing from foundational concepts of machine learning and quantum computing, we discuss various technical contributions, strengths and similarities of the research work in this domain. We also elaborate upon the recent progress of different quantum machine learning approaches, their complexity, and applications in various fields such as physics, chemistry and natural language processing. © 2013 IEEE.","quantum algorithms; quantum computing; Quantum machine learning; QuBit","Agricultural robots; Algorithmic languages; Data handling; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Quantum theory; Qubits; Classical approach; Hardware and software; Machine learning applications; Machine learning technology; NAtural language processing; Quantum algorithms; Quantum phenomena; Technical contribution; Learning algorithms","","","","","","","Smith R.S., Curtis M.J., Zeng W.J., A Practical Quantum Instruction Set Architecture, (2016); Schuld M., Sinayskiy I., Petruccione F., The quest for a quantum neural network, Quantum Inf.

Reservoir computing is an efficient learning paradigm that utilizes nonlinear dynamical systems for temporal information processing, i.e., processing of input sequences to produce output sequences. Here we propose quantum reservoir computing that harnesses complex dissipative quantum dynamics. Our class of quantum reservoirs is universal, in that any nonlinear fading memory map can be approximated arbitrarily closely and uniformly over all inputs by a quantum reservoir from this class. We describe a subclass of the universal class that is readily implementable using quantum gates native to current noisy gate-model quantum computers. Proof-of-principle experiments on remotely accessed cloud-based superconducting quantum computers demonstrate that small and noisy quantum reservoirs can tackle high-order nonlinear temporal tasks. Our theoretical and experimental results pave the path for attractive temporal processing applications of near-term gate-model quantum computers of increasing fidelity but without quantum error correction, signifying the potential of these devices for wider applications including neural modeling, speech recognition, and natural language processing, going beyond static classification and regression tasks. © 2020 American Physical Society.","","Dynamical systems; Error correction; Learning systems; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Nonlinear dynamical systems; Quantum theory; Qubits; Speech recognition; Dissipative quantum dynamics; NAtural language processing; Proof-of-principle experiments; Quantum error corrections; Reservoir Computing; Static classification; Temporal information processing; Temporal processing; Computer circuits","","","","","Keisuke Fujii; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Monbusho, (JPMXS0118067285); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Monbusho","The authors thank Keisuke Fujii for an insightful discussion.

This is a hybrid field in which the potential of quantum mechanics is exploited and applied to critical aspects of language processing, involving different NLP tasks. Approaches developed so far span from those that demonstrate the quantum advantage only at the theoretical level to the ones implementing algorithms on quantum hardware. This paper aims to list the approaches developed so far, categorizing them by type, i.e., theoretical work and those implemented on classical or quantum hardware; by task, i.e., general purpose such as syntax-semantic representation or specific NLP tasks, like sentiment analysis or question answering; and by the resource used in the evaluation phase, i.e., whether a benchmark dataset or a custom one has been used. The advantages offered by QNLP are discussed, both in terms of performance and methodology, and some considerations about the possible usage QNLP approaches in the place of state-of-the-art deep learning-based ones are given. © 2022 by the authors.

Then, we generalize our method to use quantum circuits of sentences as an input for the Q-LSTM cell. This enables us to translate sentences in different languages.

Ongoing work in this field attempts to incorporate grammatical structure into algorithms that compute meaning. In [5, 7], Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark introduce such a model (the CSC model) based on tensor product composition. While this algorithm has many advantages, its implementation is hampered by the large classical computational resources that it requires. In this work we show how computational shortcomings of the CSC approach could be resolved using quantum computation (possibly in addition to existing techniques for dimension reduction). We address the value of quantum RAM [8] for this model and extend an algorithm from Wiebe, Braun and Lloyd [24] into a quantum algorithm to categorize sentences in CSC. Our new algorithm demonstrates a quadratic speedup over classical methods under certain conditions. ï¿½ W. Zeng & B.

We witness its power in various domains such as banking, business, and the marketing industry. We already know how classical AI and machine learning can change and improve technology. Quantum natural language processing (QNLP) is a young and gradually emerging technology that can provide a quantum advantage for NLP tasks. In this paper, we show the first application of QNLP for sentiment analysis and achieve perfect test set accuracy for three different kinds of simulations and decent accuracy for experiments run on a noisy quantum device. We utilize the lambeq QNLP toolkit and t|ket > by Cambridge Quantum (Quantinuum) to produce the results.  © 2022 IEEE.","lambeq; Quantum Computing; Quantum Natural Language Processing","Learning algorithms; Quantum computers; Technology transfer; Emerging technologies; Lambeq; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Power; Quantinuum computing; Quantinuum natural language processing; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","Preskill J., Quantum computing in the nisq era and beyond, Quantum, 2, (2018); Coecke B., Horsman D., Kissinger A., Wang Q., Kindergarden quantum mechanics graduates (..or how i learned to stop gluing lego together and love the zx-calculus), 2021; Coecke B., Kissinger A., Picturing Quantum Processes: A First Course in Quantum Theory and Diagrammatic Reasoning.

At the same time, quantum computers have become much more powerful, and announcements of major advances are frequently in the news. The mathematical techniques underlying both these areas have more in common than is sometimes realized. Vector spaces took a position at the axiomatic heart of quantum mechanics in the 1930s, and this adoption was a key motivation for the derivation of logic and probability from the linear geometry of vector spaces. Quantum interactions between particles are modelled using the tensor product, which is also used to express objects and operations in artificial neural networks. This paper describes some of these common mathematical areas, including examples of how they are used in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in automated reasoning and natural language processing (NLP). Techniques discussed include vector spaces, scalar products, subspaces and implication, orthogonal projection and negation, dual vectors, density matrices, positive operators, and tensor products. Application areas include information retrieval, categorization and implication, modelling word-senses and disambiguation, inference in knowledge bases, decision making, and semantic composition. Some of these approaches can potentially be implemented on quantum hardware. Many of the practical steps in this implementation are in early stages, and some are already realized. Explaining some of the common mathematical tools can help researchers in both AI and quantum computing further exploit these overlaps, recognizing and exploring new directions along the way. © 2021 AI Access Foundation.","","Computation theory; Decision making; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Semantics; Tensors; Vectors; Automated reasoning; Axiomatics; Computer science and technologies; Linear geometry; Logic and probability; Quanta computers; Quantum interactions; Tensor products; Time quantum; Vector space models; Vector spaces","","","","","","","Aaronson S., Quantum computing since Democritus, (2013); Aaronson S., Read the fine print, Nature Physics, 11, 4, pp. 291-293, (2015); Abbas A., Sutter D., Zoufal C., Lucchi A., Figalli A., Woerner S., The power of quantum neural networks, Nature Computational Science, 1, 6, pp. 403-409, (2021); Abramsky S., Coecke B., A categorical semantics of quantum protocols, Proceedings of the 19th Annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, pp. 415-425, (2004); Abramsky S., Coecke B., Categorical quantum mechanics, Handbook of quantum logic and quantum structures, 2, pp. 261-325, (2009); Aerts D., Czachor M., Quantum aspects of semantic analysis and symbolic artificial intelligence, J.

WSN comprises a massive number of SNs and records the position of the nodes, which becomes a tedious process. Besides, the SNs might be subjected to node mobility and the position alters with time. So, a precise node localization (NL) manner is required for determining the location of the SNs. In this view, this paper presents a new quantum bird migration optimizer-based NL (QBMA-NL) technique for WSN. The goal of the QBMA-NL approach is for determining the position of unknown nodes in the network by the use of anchor nodes. The QBMA-NL technique is mainly based on the mating behavior of bird species at the time of mating season. In addition, an objective function is derived based on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and Euclidean distance from the known to unknown SNs. For demonstrating the improved performance of the QBMA-NL technique, a wide range of simulations take place and the results reported the supreme performance over the recent NL techniques. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Even so, we contend that induction, i.e., learning from empirical data, cannot constitute a full-fledged form of intelligence on its own, and it is necessary to combine it with deduction, i.e., reasoning on theoretical grounds, in order to achieve the ultimate goal of Strong AI or Artificial General Intelligence. We therefore think of the possibility of integrating Symbolic and Statistical AI, and discuss Quantum Linguistics by Bob Coecke et al., which, arguably, may be seen as the categorical integration of Symbolic and Statistical AI, and as a paradigmatic case of Integrated AI in Natural Language Processing. And we apply it to cognitive bias problems in the Kahneman-Tversky tradition, giving a novel account of them from the standpoints of Symbolic/Statistical/Integrated AI, and thus elucidating the nature of machine biases in them. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","","Intelligent systems; Natural language processing systems; Artificial general intelligences; Bias problems; Cognitive bias; Cutting edge technology; Empirical data; NAtural language processing; Quantum linguistics; Systems analysis","","","","","","","Abramsky S., Coecke B., A categorical semantics of quantum protocols, Proceedings of the 19th Annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, pp. 415-425, (2004); Caliskan A., Semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases, Science, 356, pp. 183-186, (2017); Coecke B., Et al., Mathematical foundations for a compositional distributional model of meaning, Linguist.

In this paper, we propose a quantum neural network, in which the quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is used to optimize parameters. To analysze the system performance, it has been applied to function fitting and data classification and it is shown by classical simulation and experimentation that the proposed model is more efficient and powerful than ANN for a lot of experimental tasks.

However, existing method requires the number of qubits is equal to the dimension of the word vectors, and may result in a surge of the qubit number. To address this problem, we propose a duplication-free quantum long short-term memory neural network (DQLSTM). Specifically, our DQLSTM adopts the amplitude encoding method to store the classical information, and further can reduce the requirement for the number of qubits.

The advent of Deep Learning and Big Data in the last decade has contributed to make it even more popular. Many companies, both large ones and SMEs, have created specific departments for ML and data analysis, being in fact their main activity in many cases. This current exploitation of ML should not mislead us; while it is a mature field of knowledge, there is still room for many novel contributions, namely, a better understanding of the underlying Mathematics, proposal and tuning of algorithms suitable for new problems (e.g., Natural Language Processing), automation and optimization of the search of parameters, etc. Within this framework of new contributions to ML, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged strongly lately, speeding up ML calculations and providing alternative representations to existing approaches. This special session includes six high-quality papers dealing with some of the most relevant aspects of QML, including analysis of learning in quantum computing and quantum annealers, quantum versions of classical ML models ""like neural networks or learning vector quantization"", and quantum learning approaches for measurement and control. © ESANN 2020 - Proceedings, 28th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning.","","Deep learning; Intelligent computing; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Quality control; Quantum computers; High quality papers; Learning Vector Quantization; Measurement and control; NAtural language processing; Quantum Computing; Quantum learning; Quantum machines; Real-world problem; Learning systems","","","","","","","Shalev-Shwartz S., Ben-David S., Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms, (2014); Theodoridis S., Machine Learning: A Bayesian and Optimization Perspective, (2020); Alpaydin E., Introduction to Machine Learning, (2014); Soria E., Martine-Guerrero J.

A large number of people are using internet-based services as a result of enhanced internet infrastructure and decreased costs. As a result, such businesses' attempts to penetrate internet media are disrupted. The e-commerce company, like Amazon, offers both customer-to-customer and business-to-business services in the apparel sector. Companies must understand the needs of buyers to maximize their profits. As a result, consumer sentiment analysis is carried out. However, because this procedure is time-consuming, it is made automatically utilizing artificial intelligence approaches.

Among different quantum algorithms, Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) for Quantum Machine Learning (QML) show promises to realize quantum advantages on the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) Machines. Therefore, to facilitate the QML and PQC research, a recent python library called TorchQuantum has been released. It can construct, simulate, and train PQC for machine learning tasks with high speed and convenient debugging supports. Besides quantum for ML, we want to raise the community s attention on the reversed direction: ML for quantum. Specifically, the TorchQuantum library also supports using data-driven ML models to solve problems in quantum system research, such as predicting the impact of quantum noise on circuit fidelity and improving the quantum circuit compilation efficiency. This paper presents a case study of the ML for quantum part in TorchQuantum. Since estimating the noise impact on circuit reliability is an essential step toward understanding and mitigating noise, we propose to leverage classical ML to predict noise impact on circuit fidelity. I nspired by the natural graph representation of quantum circuits, we propose to leverage a graph transformer model to predict the noisy circuit fidelity.We firstly collect a large dataset with a variety of quantum circuits and obtain their fidelity on noisy simulators and real machines. Then we embed each circuit into a graph with gate and noise properties as node features, and adopt a graph transformer to predict the fidelity.We can avoid exponential classical simulation cost and efficiently estimate fidelity with polynomial complexity. Evaluated on 5 thousand random and algorithm circuits, the graph transformer predictor can provide accurate fidelity estimation with RMSE error 0.04 and outperform a simple neural networkbased model by 0.02 on average. It can achieve 0.99 and 0.95 R2 scores for random and algorithm circuits, respectively. Compared with circuit simulators, the predictor has over 200× speedup for estimating the fidelity. The datasets and predictors can be accessed in the TorchQuantum library.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","","Computer software; Forecasting; Large dataset; Quantum efficiency; Quantum noise; Quantum optics; Timing circuits; Case-studies; Efficiency improvement; Machine-learning; Noise impact; Parameterized; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum machines; Speed improvement; Machine learning","","","","","DOE NQI Center; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-SC0020289, OMA-2016136, DE-SC0020331); U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; STAQ, (NSF Phy-1818914); National Science Foundation, NSF, (1943349); National Science Foundation, NSF; Qualcomm Innovation, (CCF-1730082/1730449)","Funding text 1: We thank National Science Foundation, MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, and Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship for supporting this research.

In fact, besides natural language, many other things can be implemented in a quantum-native, compositional and meaning-aware manner, and we provide the reader with some indications of that broader pictorial landscape, including our account on the notion of compositionality. We also provide some guidance for the actual execution, so that the reader can give it a go as well. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","Compositionality; DisCoPy software; Quantum natural language processing; String diagrams; ZX-calculus","","","","","","","","Abramsky S., Retracing some paths in process algebra, CONCUR'96: Concurrency theory, vol. 1119 of Lecture notes in computer science, pp. 1-17, (1996); Abramsky S., Coecke B., A categorical semantics of quantum protocols, Proceedings of the 19th annual IEEE symposium on logic in computer science (LICS), pp. 415-425, (2004); Adjukiewicz K., Die syntaktische Konnexität, Studia Philosophica, (1935); Baez J.C., Fong B., A compositional framework for passive linear networks, (2015); Baez J.C., Stay M., Physics, topology, logic and computation: A Rosetta stone, New structures for physics, lecture notes in physics, pp. 95-172, (2011); Bankova D., Coecke B., Lewis M., Marsden D., Graded hyponymy for compositional distributional semantics, Journal of Language Modelling, 6, 2, pp. 225-260, (2019); Bar-Hillel Y., A quasiarithmetical notation for syntactic description, Language, 29, pp. 47-58, (1953); Barrett J., Information processing in generalized probabilistic theories, Physical Review A, 75, (2007); Benedetti M., Lloyd E., Sack S., Fiorentini M., Parameterized quantum circuits as machine learning models, Quantum Science and Technology, 4, (2019); Bolt J., Coecke B., Genovese F., Lewis M., Marsden D., Piedeleu R., Interacting conceptual spaces I: Grammatical composition of concepts, Concepts and their applications, synthese library, studies in epistemology, logic, methodology, and philosophy of science, (2018); Bonchi F., Sobocinski P., Zanasi F., A categorical semantics of signal flow graphs, CONCUR'14: Concurrency theory.

The creation of these embeddings, is conducted by a classical computer, while the quantum computer handles the search process through the database. This method is very efficient in terms of qubits, enabling large amounts of data to be stored within a single quantum register.

The role of phonological recoding in reading has long been debated in the field of psycholinguistics. Most relevant studies have mainly focused on examining the role of phonological recoding in word recognition. Three major theoretical approaches have been proposed for lexical access. First, the phonological mediation model assumes that the meaning of a word is accessed through its phonology; that is, the sequence of the word recognition process is orthography phonology semantics. Phonological recoding of a word occurs prior to the access of its meaning (Lukatela & Turvey, 1994; Rayner, Pollatsek, & Binder, 1998; Van Orden, Johnston, & Hale, 1988). Second, the direct access route model assumes that the meaning of a word can be directly accessed through the transition from orthography to semantics without the mediation of phonology (M. Coltheart & Coltheart, 1997; Taft & Van Graan, 1998). The model, however, does not deny the possibility of phonological activation. Rather, it assumes that phonological recoding occurs concurrently to or later than the access of the word’s meaning. Third, the dual route model suggests that two parallel running routes can achieve lexical access: one is the phonologically mediated route, and the other is the direct access route (M. Coltheart, 2000). The route that achieves lexical access depends on the route that runs the fastest (Barron, 1986; Paap, Noel, & Johansen, 1992). McCusker, Hillinger, and Bias (1981) indicated that the difficulty of material, subjects’ reading fluency, the frequency of occurrence of items, and task demands can determine the use of phonological recoding. Chinese is a logographic language and is also regarded as a phonologically opaque one. Nevertheless, studies investigating the time course of phonological activation in Chinese word recognition have yielded inconsistent results. Although some evidence has suggested that phonology can be activated very early in the word recognition process when Chinese readers read Chinese words or sentences (Guo, Peng, & Liu, 2005; Tan, Hoosain, & Peng, 1995; Zhang & Perfetti, 1993), it remains controversial whether phonological recoding plays a crucial role in word recognition and text comprehension. Few studies have measured Chinese subjects’ reading comprehension under the condition of articulatory suppression, which has been proven to interfere with phonological recoding (Lu & Zhang, 2007; Ding & Wang, 2006). However, the results of such studies have been inconsistent, and whether phonological recoding is important for Chinese text comprehension remains unclear. This study conducted two eye-tracking experiments by using the same experimental paradigm implemented by Guan (2015, 2020) to investigate whether adult Chinese readers need to rely on phonological recoding to understand short expository texts and also whether readers without the background knowledge relevant to domain-specific texts must rely more on phonological recoding to comprehend them. In Experiment 1, 30 university students in Taipei were recruited whose mother tongue was Mandarin Chinese. They were asked to read 20 short expository texts (each one was 350 characters in length) under five different reading conditions: articulatory suppression, reading aloud, concurrent reading and listening to an irrelevant text (IRS), reading while listening to the same text (RWL), and silent reading. The topics of the texts included, for example, “advice for new graduates when entering workforce,” “the impact of 3C products on human cognition,” “water pollution,” “the color of eggs,” “the crisis of water resources,” “the function of sun light,” “the philosopher and the frog,” “Mr. thought,” “experiment with monkeys,” “the stereotypes of teachers in Taiwan,” and “the influences of watching TV on small children.” Subjects’ reading time and comprehension score for each text as well as their eye movements were recorded, which were then analyzed by several linear or generalized linear mixed models to find the best fitting model for each dependent variable. The results revealed that articulatory suppression significantly impaired reading comprehension and caused a larger regression ratio in text reading as well as a higher rereading rate on target words, whereas the effects of the other reading conditions on comprehension did not differ from each other. These results suggest that phonological recoding is essential for Chinese expository text comprehension and word recognition. Reading aloud, compared with silent reading, significantly increased the overall reading time, mean fixation duration, and number of fixations in a text but substantially reduced the mean saccade length and regression ratio. In word-level processing, reading aloud led to a much longer first fixation duration, gaze duration, rereading time, and total reading time on target words selected in the texts. Through word-by-word reading, reading aloud seemed to facilitate integrated sentence meaning, but it failed to significantly enhance overall reading comprehension. Moreover, RWL caused higher rereading rates on target words than did silent reading, and it did not improve reading comprehension. In line with results found under the reading aloud condition, the null effects of reading aloud and RWL on reading comprehension could indicate that both reading conditions make the covert phonological recoding during silent reading overt and therefore imposed similar effects on reading comprehension to those exerted by the phonological recoding in silent reading. Experiment 2 was conducted to further examine whether subjects’ background knowledge regarding the text content would moderate their reliance on phonological recoding in understanding domain-specific texts, such that subjects without much background knowledge would rely more on phonological recoding in the processing of unfamiliar terms and text content. To this end, 15 excerpts from journal articles in Scientific American were used as experimental materials. The topics of these texts were all about physics, such as the Higgs boson, quantum computing, loop quantum gravity, antimatter, charge-coupled devices, and 3He superfluid. The same experimental paradigm as in Experiment 1 was used in Experiment 2, and a different sample of 30 university students in Taipei were recruited as participants. Half majored in humanities and social sciences and had no background knowledge in physics. The other half of the students majored in natural sciences, such as physics, atmospheric physics, and materials science; therefore, they had background knowledge in physics. Participants were asked to read the texts and answer four comprehension questions after reading each text. The results revealed that only background knowledge had a significant effect on reading comprehension, whereas reading conditions and their interaction with background knowledge did not exhibit any significant effects. Participants with relevant background knowledge performed significantly better than did their counterparts. However, background knowledge did not moderate participants’ dependency on phonological recoding in reading comprehension. It seems that phonological recoding did not play a crucial role in understanding short domain-specific texts. Analysis of participants’ eye movements indicated that reading aloud could slow their reading speed and reduce their regression ratio, but it did not enhance reading comprehension. RWL increased the rereading rate on target words in short expository texts, and it increased reading time and the mean fixation duration in domain specific texts. IRS did not affect comprehension performance; it only increased the rereading rate on domain-specific target words and prolonged the first fixation duration for participants without relevant background knowledge. In sum, the results of this study suggest that phonological recoding provides critical support for Chinese adult readers to comprehend short expository texts, but it only plays a minor role in understanding domain-specific texts. When participants read domain-specific texts, it was their background knowledge that dominated their reading comprehension performance. © 2020, National Taiwan Normal University.

This preliminary study investigates how sentiment can be represented correctly and efficiently for quantum natural language processing (QNLP). In particular, we present four possible approaches for representing sentiment words in the quantum case. We propose to utilize two quantum operations (i.e., X gate and Z-X gate), each with two different placements, to represent a negative sentence in a quantum circuit. Subsequently, we train the corresponding state vector using several classical classifiers: SVM, SPSA, and a combination of both, then evaluate the result in terms of accuracy. Experimental results show that the third approach, i.e., adding an X-gate at the end of the sentence outperforms other settings. Additionally, the third approach, along with the combined classifier of SVM and SPSA, reaches up to 81.67% accuracy. The proposed method can be helpful for applications of sentiment analysis in quantum computers.  © 2022 IEEE.","quantum representation; sentiment classification; SPSA; SVM","Optimization; Quantum computers;

Examples include Natural Language Processing (NLP) where sentence classification experiments have been carried out, as well as procedural generation, where tasks such as geopolitical map creation, and image manipulation have been performed. We explore applications at the intersection of these two areas by designing a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for sentence generation. Our algorithm is based on the well-known simulated annealing technique for combinatorial optimisation. An implementation is provided and used to demonstrate successful sentence generation on both simulated and real quantum hardware. A variant of our algorithm can also used for music generation. This paper aims to be self-contained, introducing all the necessary background on NLP and quantum computing along the way. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.","","Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Simulated annealing; Image manipulation; Language processing; Medium-scale; Natural language generation; Natural languages; Proof of concept; Quantum Computing; Quantum device; Quantum-classical; Sentence classifications; Combinatorial optimization","","","","","","","Ibm’s roadmap for scaling quantum technology, (2020); Aaronson Scott, Chen Lijie, Complexity-theoretic foundations of quantum supremacy experiments, (2016); Abbaszade Mina, Salari Vahid, Mousavi Seyed Shahin, Zomorodi Mariam, Zhou Xujuan, Application of quantum natural language processing for language translation, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 130434-130448, (2021); Abramsky Samson, Coecke Bob, A categorical semantics of quantum protocols, Proceedings of the 19th Annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, pp. 415-425, (2004); Aharonov Dorit, Van Dam Wim, Kempe Julia, Landau Zeph, Lloyd Seth, Regev Oded, Adiabatic quantum computation is equivalent to standard quantum computation, SIAM review, 50, 4, pp. 755-787, (2008); Arute Frank, Arya Kunal, Babbush Ryan, Bacon Dave, Bardin Joseph C., Barends Rami, Biswas Rupak, Boixo Sergio, Brandao Fernando G.

In the last few years, several researchers have emerged in quantum computing in accordance with the artificial intelligence field. Natural language processing is one of the prominent subfields of artificial intelligence. Quantum computing can be applied to the applications of natural language processing for better performance. One of the vital applications of natural language processing is Parts-Of-Speech (POS) tagging. It is prerequired for many natural language processing applications. In this paper, we have performed POS tagging of the Mizo language using classical Long short-term memory (LSTM). Subsequently, quantum-enhanced long short-term memory (QLSTM) has also been used to perform POS tagging of the Mizo language. The approaches mentioned above have been tested on the Mizo-tagged corpus, and experimental results have shown that quantum computing approaches such as QLSTM need the inclusion of new technologies to achieve significant results.  © 2022 IEEE.","Natural language processing; POS tagging; Quantum computing; Quantum machine learning","Brain; Computational linguistics; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Syntactics; Complex problems; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Part of speech tagging; Parts-of-speech tagging; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Long short-term memory","","","","","MeitY Quantum Computing Applications Lab","The work presented here falls under the Research Project Grant Ref.

Compared to magnetic or electric fields, local electron density fluctuations caused by changes in the atomic environment provide a much higher spatial resolution for the addressing of nuclear spins in qubit registers or within a single molecule. In this article we investigate the possibility of coherent spin control in atoms or molecules via nuclear quadrupole resonance from first principles. An abstract, time-dependent description is provided which entails and reflects on commonly applied approximations. This formalism is then used to propose a method we refer to as ""optical""nuclear electric resonance (ONER). It employs pulsed optical excitations in the UV-visible light spectrum to modulate the electric field gradient at the position of a specific nucleus of interest by periodic changes of the surrounding electron density. Possible realizations and limitations of ONER for atomically resolved spin manipulation are discussed and tested on Be9 as an atomic benchmark system via electronic structure theory. © 2023 American Physical Society.

In the game theory, both positive and negative instances of the data are needed to understand so that better training can be given for the model using the pre-processed information. The positive and negative instances need to be managed by the model according to the understanding of the model. Machine learning algorithms will work more efficiently if the data is accurate. But the sentimental analysis is needed to understand without the properly aligned data in the proper order or format. The proper arrangement of the data can make a useful model for the game playing prediction. The experiment will give the result of the genre of the game the people are liking to play with respect to both positive and negative instance. The choice of the game will be based on human sentiments. An accuracy of 85% is got in the prediction to verify and predict the game the specific age group will like to opt. Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) is the novel concept to implement in game theory and game playing prediction. © 2020 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Prediction; Quantum Neural Networks","Data handling; Forecasting; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Age groups; Game playing; NAtural language processing; Negative instances; Novel concept; Processed information; Quantum neural networks; Game theory","","","","","","","Chaddad A., Et al., Deep radiomic nalyssis based on modeling information flow in convolutional neural networks, IEEE Access, 7, (2019); Chaddad A., Et al., Deep radiomic analysis of MRI related to Alzheimer's disease, IEEE Access, 6, (2018); Sarraf S., Et al., Mcadnnet: Recognizing stages of cognitive impariment through efficient convolutional fmri and MRI neural network topology models, IEEE Access, 4, (2016); Ahmed S., Et al., Ensembles of pat ch based classifiers for diagnosis of Alzheimer's diseases, IEEE Access, 7, (2019); Mefraz Khan N., Et al., Transfer learning with intelligent training data selection for prediction of Alzheimer's disease, IEEE Access, 7, (2019); Basher A., Et al., Hippocampus localization using two st age ensemble hough convolutional neural network, IEEE Access, 7, (2019); Feng C., Et al., Deep learning framework for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis via 3dcnn and fsbi-lstm, IEEE Access, 7, (2019); Nazir S., Et al., Big data visualization in cardiology-a systemat ic review and future directions, 7, (2019); Dhayne H., Et al., Search of Big Medical Data Integration Solutions-A Comprehensive Survey, 7, (2019); Panayides A.S., Et al., Radiogenomics for P Recision Medicine with A Big Data Analytics Perspective, 23, 5, (2019); Sun H., Et al., Intelligent Analysis of Medical Big Data Based on Deep Learning, 7, (2019); Jiang C., Et al., Health Big Data Classification Using Improved Radial Basis Function Neural Network and Nearest Neighbor P Ropagation Algorithm, 7, (2019); Tsang G., Et al., Harnessing the power of machine learning in dement ia informatics research: Issues, opport unities and challenges, IEEE Access, 3, (2020); Nie L., Et al., Multiview physician-specific attributes fusion for health seeking, IEEE Access, 47, 11, (2017); Pavel M., Et al., The role of technology and engineering models in t ransforming healt hcare, IEEE Access, 6, (2013); Mehran, Et al., Systematic poisoning attacks on and defenses for machine learning in health care, 19, 6, (2015); Sun Y., Et al., Diagnosis and Analysis of Diabetic Ret Inopat Hy Based on Electronic Health Records, 4, (2019); Rios-Romenets S., Et al., Adherence/Ret Ention Alzheimer's Prevention Init Iative Colombia P Lan, (2018); Cordes D., Et al., Advances in Functional Magnet Ic Resonance Imaging Data Analysis Methods Using Empirical Mode Decomposition to Invest Igate Temporal Changes in Early Parkinson's Disease, (2018); Liu L., Et al., Age Stratification Corrects Bias in Estimated Hazard of APOE Genotype for Alzheimer's Disease, (2018)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","4th International Conference on IoT in Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud, ISMAC 2020","7 October 2020 through 9 October 2020","Palladam","164900","","978-172815464-0","","","English","Proc.

This work proposes a vertical federated learning architecture based on variational quantum circuits to demonstrate the competitive performance of a quantum-enhanced pre-trained BERT model for text classification. In particular, our proposed hybrid classical-quantum model consists of a novel random quantum temporal convolution (QTC) learning framework replacing some layers in the BERT-based decoder. Our experiments on intent classification show that our proposed BERT-QTC model attains competitive experimental results in the Snips and ATIS spoken language datasets. Particularly, the BERT-QTC boosts the performance of the existing quantum circuit-based language model in two text classification datasets by 1.57% and 1.52% relative improvements. Furthermore, BERT-QTC can be feasibly deployed on both existing commercial-accessible quantum computation hardware and CPU-based interface for ensuring data isolation. © 2022 IEEE","heterogeneous computing; Quantum machine learning; spoken language understanding; temporal convolution; text classification","Classification (of information); Learning systems; Machine learning; Quantum computers; Text processing; Heterogeneous computing; Machine-learning; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Rich features; Spoken language understanding; Temporal convolution; Text classification; Convolution","","","","","","","Stolcke A., Ries K., Coccaro N., Shriberg E., Bates R., Jurafsky D., Taylor P., Martin R., Ess-Dykema C.V., Meteer M., Dialogue act modeling for automatic tagging and recognition of conversational speech, Computational linguistics, 26, 3, pp. 339-373, (2000); Wang D., Brown G.J., Computational auditory scene analysis: Principles, algorithms, and applications, (2006); Wang Y.-Y., Deng L., Acero A., Spoken language understanding, IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 22, 5, pp. 16-31, (2005); Coucke A., Saade A., Ball A., Bluche T., Caulier A., Leroy D., Doumouro C., Gisselbrecht T., Caltagirone F., Lavril T., Et al., Snips voice platform: an embedded spoken language understanding system for private-by-design voice interfaces, (2018); Hemphill C.T., Godfrey J.J., Doddington G.R., The atis spoken language systems pilot corpus, Speech and Natural Language: Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Hidden Valley, (1990); Devlin J., Chang M.-W., Lee K., Toutanova K., Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Carlini N., Liu C., Erlingsson U., Kos J., Song D., The secret sharer: Evaluating and testing unintended memorization in neural networks, 28th {USENIX} Security Symposium ({USENIX} Security 19), pp. 267-284, (2019); Carlini N., Tramer F., Wallace E., Jagielski M., Herbert-Voss A., Lee K., Roberts A., Brown T., Song D., Erlingsson U., Et al., Extracting training data from large language models, (2020); Voigt P., Von dem Bussche A., The eu general data protection regulation (gdpr), A Practical Guide, (2017); Yang C.-H.H., Siniscalchi S.M., Lee C.-H., Pate-aae: Incorporating adversarial autoencoder into private aggregation of teacher ensembles for spoken command classification, Proc.
