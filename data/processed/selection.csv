Application of Quantum Tensor Networks for Protein Classification,"Computational methods in drug discovery significantly reduce both time and experimental costs. Nonetheless, certain computational tasks in drug discovery can be daunting with classical computing techniques which can be potentially overcome using quantum computing. A crucial task within this domain involves the functional classification of proteins. However, a challenge lies in adequately representing lengthy protein sequences given the limited number of qubits available in existing noisy quantum computers. We show that protein sequences can be thought of as sentences in natural language processing and can be parsed using the existing Quantum Natural Language framework into parameterized quantum circuits of reasonable qubits, which can be trained to solve various protein-related machine-learning problems. We classify proteins based on their sub-cellular locations - a pivotal task in bioinformatics that is key to understanding biological processes and disease mechanisms. Leveraging the quantum-enhanced processing capabilities, we demonstrate that Quantum Tensor Networks (QTN) can effectively handle the complexity and diversity of protein sequences. We present a detailed methodology that adapts QTN architectures to the nuanced requirements of protein data, supported by comprehensive experimental results. We demonstrate two distinct QTNs, inspired by classical recurrent neural networks (RNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), to solve the binary classification task mentioned above. Our top-performing quantum model has achieved a 94% accuracy rate, which is comparable to the performance of a classical model that uses the ESM2 protein language model embeddings. It's noteworthy that the ESM2 model is extremely large, containing 8 million parameters in its smallest configuration, whereas our best quantum model requires only around 800 parameters. We demonstrate that these hybrid models exhibit promising performance, showcasing their potential to compete with classical models of similar complexity. © 2024 ACM.",Kundu D.; Ghosh A.; Ekambaram S.; Wang J.; Dokholyan N.; Ghosh S.,10.1145/3649476.3658701,2024,Conference paper,Scopus,Aceito,,,Classificação de proteínas usando abordagens de Natural Language Processing e abordagens quânticas,,Descrição,Valor

Semantic Similarities Using Classical Embeddings in Quantum NLP,"We demonstrate how word and text embeddings as n-dimensional real vectors used in classical Natural Language Processing (NLP)/AI applications can be mapped to quantum states or quantum embedding representations in Quantum Applications using NLP and AI. Models like fastText [1], [2], GloVe [3], Numberbatch [4], or BERT [5] are common NLP embedding vectors or models that encode semantic properties of words or text fragments. We use these models to evaluate mapping properties and compression rate, as well as information preservation in quantum embeddings. For mapping embedding vectors to quantum states, we use encoding strategies, such as Amplitude Encoding. The encoding strategies allow us to map large dense vectors from the embedding models to compact quantum states using different compression ratios. The compression with Amplitude Encoding can be 2n to N, resulting in a mapping of a 1,024-dimensional vector of reals in the classical environment to a 10-qubit state. The goal of this work is to evaluate these strategies with respect to their compression ratio and measure the preservation of semantic information using similarity scores. We show that the resulting quantum embeddings based on mapped classical computing embeddings exhibit the same relational properties and that there is no significant loss of semantic information in the conversion from classical n-dimensional real vector embeddings to qubit states. We conclude that the experimental results allow us to quantum compute semantic similarities of words or text, reusing existing and freely available embedding models from classical NLP/AI computing. © 2024 IEEE.",Cavar D.; Zhang C.,10.1109/QCE60285.2024.10350,2024,Conference paper,Scopus,Aceito,,,"Compara os embeddings clássicos a abordagem de embeddings quanticos, usando estado quantico para preservar as propriedades semanticas dos textos",,WoS (documentos encontrados),193

Enhancing Contextual Understanding in Knowledge Graphs: Integration of Quantum Natural Language Processing with Neo4j LLM Knowledge Graph,"Traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs), such as Neo4j, face challenges in managing high-dimensional relationships and capturing semantic nuances due to their deterministic nature. Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) introduces probabilistic reasoning into the KG context. This integration leverages quantum principles, such as superposition, which allows relationships to exist in multiple states simultaneously, and entanglement, where the state of one entity dynamically influences the state of another. This quantum-based probabilistic reasoning provides a richer, more flexible representation of connections, moving beyond binary relationships to model the nuances and variability of real-world interactions. Our research demonstrates that QNLP enhances Neo4j's ability to analyze context-rich data, improving tasks like entity extraction and knowledge inference. By modeling relationship states probabilistically, QNLP addresses limitations in traditional methods, providing nuanced insights and enabling more advanced, context-aware NLP applications. © 2024 IEEE.",Bharti S.; Lo D.C.-T.; Shi Y.,10.1109/BigData62323.2024.10826002,2024,Conference paper,Scopus,Aceito,,,"Melhora a abordagem classica de grafos de conhecimento a partir da aplicação de Quantum Natural Language Processing, melhorando a captura de contexto em relação a métodos tradicionais.",,Objetivo: Buscar artigos que apliquem processamento de linguagem natural e quantum computing em tarefas.,
"Photonics for Neuromorphic Computing: Fundamentals, Devices, and Opportunities","In the dynamic landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI), two notable phenomena are becoming predominant: the exponential growth of large AI model sizes and the explosion of massive amount of data. Meanwhile, scientific research such as quantum computing and protein synthesis increasingly demand higher computing capacities. As the Moore's Law approaches its terminus, there is an urgent need for alternative computing paradigms that satisfy this growing computing demand and break through the barrier of the von Neumann model. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the mechanism and functionality of human brains, uses physical artificial neurons to do computations and is drawing widespread attention. This review studies the expansion of optoelectronic devices on photonic integration platforms that has led to significant growth in photonic computing, where photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have enabled ultrafast artificial neural networks (ANN) with sub-nanosecond latencies, low heat dissipation, and high parallelism. In particular, various technologies and devices employed in neuromorphic photonic AI accelerators, spanning from traditional optics to PCSEL lasers are examined. Lastly, it is recognized that existing neuromorphic technologies encounter obstacles in meeting the peta-level computing speed and energy efficiency threshold, and potential approaches in new devices, fabrication, materials, and integration to drive innovation are also explored. As the current challenges and barriers in cost, scalability, footprint, and computing capacity are resolved one-by-one, photonic neuromorphic systems are bound to co-exist with, if not replace, conventional electronic computers and transform the landscape of AI and scientific computing in the foreseeable future. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",Li R.; Gong Y.; Huang H.; Zhou Y.; Mao S.; Wei Z.; Zhang Z.,10.1002/adma.202312825,2025,Review,Scopus,Rejeitado,Tipo de arquivo incorreto,,,,,
An application-agnostic AI platform to accelerate Machine Learning adoption for basic to hard ML/DL scientific use cases,"Researchers at INFN (National Institute for Nuclear Physics) face challenges from basic to hard science use cases (e.g., big-data latest generation experiments) in many areas: High Energy Physics (HEP), Astrophysics, Quantum Computing, Genomics, etc. Machine Learning (ML) adoption is ubiquitous in these areas, requiring researchers to solve problems related to the specificity of applications (e.g., tailored models and intricate domain knowledge), but also requiring solving general infrastructure-level and ML-workflow related problems. As the demand for ML solutions continues to rise across the diverse research domains, there exists a critical need for an innovative approach to accelerate ML adoption. In this regard we introduce an Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform designed as an application-agnostic Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) solution. The platform provides a paradigm shift by offering a flexible and generalized infrastructure that decouples the ML development process from the specific use cases. The AI platform is implemented as a software layer on top of our cloud platform: the INFN Cloud, a dedicated, geographically distributed infrastructure which offers composable, scalable, and open-source solutions. The AI platform leverages INFN Cloud resources and principles, gathering and orchestrating technologies to support end-to-end scalable ML solutions: Kubernetes, Kubeflow, KServe, KNative, Kueue, Horovod, etc., ensuring support for several ML frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Apache MXNet, XGBoost, etc. This paper describes the platform’s design and principles, as well as some selected use cases from Natural Language Processing and HEP domains that can take advantage of the “aaS” approach. © Copyright owned by the author(s)",Gattari M.; Giommi L.; Antonacci M.; Vino G.,10.22323/1.458.0026,2024,Conference paper,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,

Exploring Public Discourse on Quantum Technology: Overlooking Societal Implications?,"As quantum computing technologies (QCTs) move towards commercialization, understanding public perceptions and stakeholder narratives becomes crucial for their responsible development and integration into society. This paper examines how this technology is presented across media, business, and government documents using thematic narrative analysis. Our research design utilizes an extensive dataset of 165 business reports, 36 government documents, and 2,331 media articles published over the past 20 years. We employ a computational social science approach, combining BERTopic modeling with qualitative assessment to extract themes and narratives. The findings show that public discourse on quantum technology (QT) reflects prevailing social and political agendas, focusing on technical and commercial potential, global conflicts, national strategies, and social issues. Media articles provide the most balanced coverage, while business and government discourses often overlook societal implications. We emphasize the importance of informed and broad public discourse to ensure equitable and beneficial outcomes for society. © 2024 IEEE.",Pöhlmann G.; Ma C.; Suter V.; Meckel M.; Steinacker L.,10.1109/QCE60285.2024.10256,2024,Conference paper,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,
Quantum Natural Language Processing,"Language processing is at the heart of current developments in artificial intelligence, and quantum computers are becoming available at the same time. This has led to great interest in quantum natural language processing, and several early proposals and experiments. This paper surveys the state of this area, showing how NLP-related techniques have been used in quantum language processing. We examine the art of word embeddings and sequential models, proposing some avenues for future investigation and discussing the tradeoffs present in these directions. We also highlight some recent methods to compute attention in transformer models, and perform grammatical parsing. We also introduce a new quantum design for the basic task of text encoding (representing a string of characters in memory), which has not been addressed in detail before. Quantum theory has contributed toward quantifying uncertainty and explaining “What is intelligence?” In this context, we argue that “hallucinations” in modern artificial intelligence systems are a misunderstanding of the way facts are conceptualized: language can express many plausible hypotheses, of which only a few become actual. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany and Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V. 2024.",Widdows D.; Aboumrad W.; Kim D.; Ray S.; Mei J.,10.1007/s13218-024-00861-w,2024,Article,Scopus,Aceito,,,"Trata de buscar o estado da arte em aplicações de computação quântica e processamento de linguagem natural, além de fazer experimentos de text-encoding.",,,
Leveraging NLP and Quantum Computing for Advanced Agricultural Solutions,"Quantum computing and natural language processing (NLP) could transform smart farming. Decision-making and resource management improve with convergence, enabling new agricultural solutions. This technique solves traditional computing's problems with large datasets and complex language processing, making it crucial for real-time decision-making. Problems include complex quantum algorithms, NLP models in quantum frameworks, and quantum hardware. This study presents Smart Agriculture Computing based on Quantum Natural Language Processing (SAC-QNLP) to overcome the aforesaid challenges. Agricultural data systems use quantum computing, data flow, and quantum-enhanced NLP algorithms. Quantum computing assesses large, complicated datasets faster than standard methods. Thus, smart agricultural strategy apps learn more and forecast better. Increased production projections from genetic and environmental factors SAC-QNLP could change farming. A simulation evaluated SAC-QNLP's performance and scalability. Older methods use more resources, produce less precise data, and are less efficient. The results show SAC-QNLP could boost farming production and sustainability.  © 2024 IEEE.",Bhargavi G.; Das M.; Banumathi S.; Malarvizhi E.; Surendran R.,10.1109/ICECA63461.2024.10800767,2024,Conference paper,Scopus,Aceito,,,"Aplica Quantum Natural Language Processing para agricultura, mais precisamente smart farming.",,,
Near-term advances in quantum natural language processing,"This paper describes experiments showing that some tasks in natural language processing (NLP) can already be performed using quantum computers, though so far only with small datasets. We demonstrate various approaches to topic classification. The first uses an explicit word-based approach, in which word-topic weights are implemented as fractional rotations of individual qubits, and a phrase is classified based on the accumulation of these weights onto a scoring qubit, using entangling quantum gates. This is compared with more scalable quantum encodings of word embedding vectors, which are used to compute kernel values in a quantum support vector machine: this approach achieved an average of 62% accuracy on classification tasks involving over 10000 words, which is the largest such quantum computing experiment to date. We describe a quantum probability approach to bigram modeling that can be applied to understand sequences of words and formal concepts, investigate a generative approximation to these distributions using a quantum circuit Born machine, and introduce an approach to ambiguity resolution in verb-noun composition using single-qubit rotations for simple nouns and 2-qubit entangling gates for simple verbs. The smaller systems presented have been run successfully on physical quantum computers, and the larger ones have been simulated. We show that statistically meaningful results can be obtained, but the quality of individual results varies much more using real datasets than using artificial language examples from previous quantum NLP research. Related NLP research is compared, partly with respect to contemporary challenges including informal language, fluency, and truthfulness. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Widdows D.; Alexander A.; Zhu D.; Zimmerman C.; Majumder A.,10.1007/s10472-024-09940-y,2024,Article,Scopus,Aceito,,,Propoe uma abordagem baseada em Quantum Natural Language Processing para modelagem de bigramas,,,

Designing complex concentrated alloys with quantum machine learning and language modeling,"Designing novel complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) is an essential topic in materials science. However, due to the complicated high-dimensional component-property relationship, tuning material properties by researchers’ experience is challenging, even when guided by physical or empirical rules. Here, we adopt quantum computing (QC) technology and machine learning models to provide a proof-of-concept application of QC in physical metallurgy. We propose a quantum support vector machine (QSVM) model to predict single-phase CCAs. We show that fine-tuned quantum kernels with entanglement deliver promising performance, with a maximum accuracy of 89.4%. The QSVM model is then used to identify 1,741 lightweight CCAs jointly with a new text-mining-based method. Meanwhile, we devise a controllable approach to study the effect of noise on model performance and find that the noise level needs to be minimized for high-performance QSVM models. This study provides a practical and general approach to designing CCAs based on quantum technologies. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Pei Z.; Gong Y.; Liu X.; Yin J.,10.1016/j.matt.2024.05.035,2024,Article,Scopus,Aceito,,,"Aplica Quantum Natural Language Processing para design de ligas metálicas, a partir de elementos químicos, usando um modelo de linguagem que se utiliza de similaridade semantica e um algoritmo de aprendizado de máquina quântico para classificação o QSVM.",,,
The sudden disruptive rise of generative artificial intelligence? An evaluation of their impact on higher education and the global workplace,"This paper evaluates the rise of “Generative Artificial Intelligence” (GAI) in its myriad forms, with the highest profile being the “Large Language Models” (LLMs). More importantly, it analyses the potentially disruptive impact of this ascendant technology on higher education and the global workplace. The findings of this paper indicate that students pursuing higher education tend to perceive GAI favourably, as it frees them from the toil of rote-learning. However, the view is rather mixed in the case of educators, who are still coming to grips with this seemingly disruptive technology. In the case of the global labour market, GAI has the potential to decimate legions of white-collar jobs once it eliminates inherent issues of biases, security and misinformation. Despite the media's constant labelling of GAI as a disruptive technology that has suddenly burst onto the technological scene, it is evidenced in this paper that the technology has taken nearly eight decades to reach today's level of technological advancement. Further, it is far from reaching its full potential, as it is still incorporating advances in pattern recognition, planning and problem solving, and quantum computing technologies. This study also warns of concentrating the power of this game-changing technology in the hands of a few major corporate titans. © 2024 The Authors",Wong W.K.O.,10.1016/j.joitmc.2024.100278,2024,Article,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,
Generative Quantum Machine Learning via Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models,"Deep generative models are key-enabling technology to computer vision, text generation, and large language models. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have recently gained much attention due to their ability to generate diverse and high-quality samples in many computer vision tasks, as well as to incorporate flexible model architectures and a relatively simple training scheme. Quantum generative models, empowered by entanglement and superposition, have brought new insight to learning classical and quantum data. Inspired by the classical counterpart, we propose the quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic model (QuDDPM) to enable efficiently trainable generative learning of quantum data. QuDDPM adopts sufficient layers of circuits to guarantee expressivity, while it introduces multiple intermediate training tasks as interpolation between the target distribution and noise to avoid barren plateau and guarantee efficient training. We provide bounds on the learning error and demonstrate QuDDPM's capability in learning correlated quantum noise model, quantum many-body phases, and topological structure of quantum data. The results provide a paradigm for versatile and efficient quantum generative learning.  © 2024 American Physical Society.",Zhang B.; Xu P.; Chen X.; Zhuang Q.,10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.100602,2024,Article,Scopus,Aceito,,,"Introduz um modelo generativo quantico, chamado de QuDDPM.",,,

Self-supervised pre-trained neural network for quantum natural language processing,"Quantum computing models have propelled advances in many application domains. However, in the field of natural language processing (NLP), quantum computing models are limited in representation capacity due to the high linearity of the underlying quantum computing architecture.

In the classification task, we utilized an amplitude encoding algorithm and achieved perfect accuracy on the lambeq dataset discussed in literature. We obtained accuracy from 55% to 72.5% on the more complex and realistic Amazon review dataset. This is a reasonable result given the current state-of-the-art results in QNLP.

Learning the Expressibility of Quantum Circuit Ansatz Using Transformer,"With the exponentially faster computation for certain problems, quantum computing has garnered significant attention in recent years. Variational quantum algorithms are crucial methods to implement quantum computing, and an appropriate task-specific quantum circuit ansatz can effectively enhance the quantum advantage of VQAs. However, the vast search space makes it challenging to find the optimal task-specific ansatz. Expressibility, quantifying the diversity of quantum circuit ansatz states to explore the Hilbert space effectively, can be used to evaluate whether one ansatz is superior to another. In this work, using a transformer model to predict the expressibility of quantum circuit ansatze is proposed. A dataset containing random PQCs generated by the gatewise pipeline, with varying numbers of qubits and gates is constructed. The expressibility of the circuits is calculated using three measures: KL divergence, relative KL divergence, and maximum mean discrepancy. A transformer model is trained on the dataset to capture the intricate relationships between circuit characteristics and expressibility. Four evaluation metrics are employed to assess the performance of the transformer. Numerical results demonstrate that the trained model achieves high performance and robustness across various expressibility measures.

Quantum Natural Language Processing Application for Estimating SQL Query Metrics,"Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) is built on a novel, category theoretical quantum machine learning model, which we use to solve a well-researched problem in the database field: estimating metrics for SQL queries. The metrics we focus on are latency (i.e., the execution time), cost (i.e., a value of how expensive the query is in total), and cardinality (i.e., the number of rows in the result table). The critical link between QNLP and the database problem lies in using grammars, such as context-free grammar. Both natural language and SQL queries admit grammatical presentations, which allow us to develop a comprehensive framework for applying QNLP methods to solve the query estimation problem. The model comprises an encoding mechanism and a training phase, integrating classical and quantum subroutines. The encoding mechanism transforms SQL queries into parametrized quantum circuits as in QNLP. Classical optimization algorithms optimize the circuit parameters during training to predict query metrics. Comparing our model to the QNLP models, our model achieves accuracy comparable to the QNLP model in binary classification tasks. Additionally, we expand upon previous research by implementing multi-class classification tasks and comparing the cardinality estimation results to those of state-of-the-art databases.

Quantum word embedding for machine learning,"The accelerated progress in quantum computing has enabled a new form of machine intelligence that runs on quantum hardware, which holds great promise for more powerful computational models in various learning tasks. An emergent application of Quantum Machine Intelligence (QMI) is Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP). This paper proposes a multi-dimensional, finite automaton model for quantum word embedding (QWE) via the Galois field. We demonstrated the model to three applications: (1) English vocabulary, (2) amino acid-based genetic codes, and (3) DNA-based genetic codes. The numerical results obtained from the proposed algorithm for the English vocabulary indicate that it produces more representative word features than Word2Vec based on the word distance metric. Second, the proposed algorithm is also utilized to model RNA-Protein interaction based on the latent distance of a given molecule, which is demonstrated on three large datasets, namely RPI369, RPI1807, and RPI2241.

Compassionate Care with Autonomous AI Humanoid Robots in Future Healthcare Delivery: A Multisensory Simulation of Next-Generation Models,"The integration of AI and robotics in healthcare raises concerns, and additional issues regarding autonomous systems are anticipated. Effective communication is crucial for robots to be seen as “caring”, necessitating advanced mechatronic design and natural language processing (NLP). This paper examines the potential of humanoid robots to autonomously replicate compassionate care. The study employs computational simulations using mathematical and agent-based modeling to analyze human–robot interactions (HRIs) surpassing Tetsuya Tanioka’s TRETON. It incorporates stochastic elements (through neuromorphic computing) and quantum-inspired concepts (through the lens of Martha Rogers’ theory), running simulations over 100 iterations to analyze complex behaviors. Multisensory simulations (visual and audio) demonstrate the significance of “dynamic communication”, (relational) “entanglement”, and (healthcare system and robot’s function) “superpositioning” in HRIs. Quantum and neuromorphic computing may enable humanoid robots to empathetically respond to human emotions, based on Jean Watson’s ten caritas processes for creating transpersonal states. Autonomous AI humanoid robots will redefine the norms of “caring”. Establishing “pluralistic agreements” through open discussions among stakeholders worldwide is necessary to align innovations with the values of compassionate care within a “posthumanist” framework, where the compassionate care provided by Level 4 robots meets human expectations. Achieving compassionate care with autonomous AI humanoid robots involves translating nursing, communication, computer science, and engineering concepts into robotic care representations while considering ethical discourses through collaborative efforts.

Recurrent quantum embedding neural network and its application in vulnerability detection,"In recent years, deep learning has been widely used in vulnerability detection with remarkable results. These studies often apply natural language processing (NLP) technologies due to the natural similarity between code and language. Since NLP usually consumes a lot of computing resources, its combination with quantum computing is becoming a valuable research direction. In this paper, we present a Recurrent Quantum Embedding Neural Network (RQENN) for vulnerability detection. It aims to reduce the memory consumption of classical models for vulnerability detection tasks and improve the performance of quantum natural language processing (QNLP) methods. We show that the performance of RQENN achieves the above goals. Compared with the classic model, the space complexity of each stage of its execution is exponentially reduced, and the number of parameters used and the number of bits consumed are significantly reduced. Compared with other QNLP methods, RQENN uses fewer qubit resources and achieves a 15.7% higher accuracy in vulnerability detection. © The Author(s) 2024.",Song Z.; Zhou X.; Xu J.; Ding X.; Shan Z.,10.1038/s41598-024-63021-y,2024,Article,Scopus,Aceito,,,Utiliza Quantum Natural Language Processing para detectar vulnerabilidades em sistemas.,,,

Error Correction and Adaptation in Conversational AI: A Review of Techniques and Applications in Chatbots,"This study explores the progress of chatbot technology, focusing on the aspect of error correction to enhance these smart conversational tools. Chatbots, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), are increasingly prevalent across industries such as customer service, healthcare, e-commerce, and education. Despite their use and increasing complexity, chatbots are prone to errors like misunderstandings, inappropriate responses, and factual inaccuracies. These issues can have an impact on user satisfaction and trust. This research provides an overview of chatbots, conducts an analysis of errors they encounter, and examines different approaches to rectifying these errors. These approaches include using data-driven feedback loops, involving humans in the learning process, and adjusting through learning methods like reinforcement learning, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and meta-learning. Through real life examples and case studies in different fields, we explore how these strategies are implemented. Looking ahead, we explore the different challenges faced by AI-powered chatbots, including ethical considerations and biases during implementation. Furthermore, we explore the transformative potential of new technological advancements, such as explainable AI models, autonomous content generation algorithms (e.g., generative adversarial networks), and quantum computing to enhance chatbot training. Our research provides information for developers and researchers looking to improve chatbot capabilities, which can be applied in service and support industries to effectively address user requirements. © 2024 by the authors.",Izadi S.; Forouzanfar M.,10.3390/ai5020041,2024,Review,Scopus,Rejeitado,Tipo de arquivo incorreto,,,,,
Language Model Optimization Based on Quantum Machine Learning for Long Chinese Text Processing,"Chinese language presents unique challenges in text processing due to its complex structure, including high inter-lexical dependence, flexible word order, and rich contextual expressions. These characteristics make it particularly difficult for large models to effectively handle long Chinese texts using traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms. This paper explores the application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) as a solution to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in processing long Chinese texts. By leveraging the inherent advantages of QML, such as higher processing efficiency and deeper semantic understanding, this research demonstrates through experimental comparisons that QML models significantly outperform traditional ML models in both speed and comprehension accuracy. The paper systematically introduces text processing methods using both traditional ML and QML, and presents a simplified QML model designed to enhance text processing capabilities. The findings underscore the potential of QML in optimizing the future performance of LLMs, particularly for languages with complex linguistic structures like Chinese.

Entangled Meanings: Classification and Ambiguity Resolution in Near-Term QNLP,"We demonstrate two tasks in Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP): classification and disambiguation. For the classification task, we utilized an amplitude encoding algorithm and achieved perfect accuracy on the standard lambeq dataset, which is commonly used for benchmarking in quantum NLP. Additionally, we obtained accuracy from 55% to 72.5 % on a more complex and realistic Amazon review dataset, which is still a reasonable result, given the current capability of quantum computing and QNLP. Additionally, we found that UMAP is the best dimension reduction method in our experiment setting. All classification results were done on the default. qubit simulator in pennylane 0.36 python library. Our classification results highlight the potential of quantum algorithms in practical applications. For the disambiguation task, we selected 18 ambiguous nouns, 32 unambiguous nouns, and 18 different verbs. Our experiments using the QASM simulator within the qiskit Python library demonstrated that the simulator could perfectly differentiate between the various meanings of ambiguous nouns in different contexts, achieving perfect differentiation. Furthermore, we extended our study to a real quantum device, the ibm-kyoto quantum computer. There, we tested our disambiguation approach on a subset of 4 random nouns (two ambiguous and two unambiguous) and observed that ibm-kyoto could achieve an accuracy range of 82.1 % to 98.9% in disambiguation tasks, extending the datasets and improving the results of existing ambiguity resolution experiments [1]. Our work demonstrates the capability of quantum computing in dealing with real-world NLP tasks, hence contributing to the advancement of both QML and NLP. © 2024 IEEE.",Zhang C.; Kumari A.; Cavar D.,10.1109/QCE60285.2024.10355,2024,Conference paper,Scopus,Rejeitado,Duplicado,,,,,
Quantum self-attention neural networks for text classification,"An emerging direction of quantum computing is to establish meaningful quantum applications in various fields of artificial intelligence, including natural language processing (NLP). Although some efforts based on syntactic analysis have opened the door to research in quantum NLP (QNLP), limitations such as heavy syntactic preprocessing and syntax-dependent network architecture make them impracticable on larger and real-world data sets. In this paper, we propose a new simple network architecture, called the quantum self-attention neural network (QSANN), which can compensate for these limitations. Specifically, we introduce the self-attention mechanism into quantum neural networks and then utilize a Gaussian projected quantum self-attention serving as a sensible quantum version of self-attention. As a result, QSANN is effective and scalable on larger data sets and has the desirable property of being implementable on near-term quantum devices. In particular, our QSANN outperforms the best existing QNLP model based on syntactic analysis as well as a simple classical self-attention neural network in numerical experiments of text classification tasks on public data sets. We further show that our method exhibits robustness to low-level quantum noises and showcases resilience to quantum neural network architectures. © Science China Press 2024.",Li G.; Zhao X.; Wang X.,10.1007/s11432-023-3879-7,2024,Article,Scopus,Aceito,,,"Propõe o chhamado Quantum Self Atention Neural Network, que promete melhorar as representações quânticas que antes eram sintáticas.",,,
A comprehensive taxonomy of machine consciousness,"Machine consciousness (MC) is the ultimate challenge to artificial intelligence. Although great progress has been made in artificial intelligence and robotics, consciousness is still an enigma and machines are far from having it. To clarify the concepts of consciousness and the research directions of machine consciousness, in this review, a comprehensive taxonomy for machine consciousness is proposed, categorizing it into seven types: MC-Perception, MC-Cognition, MC-Behavior, MC-Mechanism, MC-Self, MC-Qualia and MC-Test, where the first six types aim to achieve a certain kind of conscious ability, and the last type aims to provide evaluation methods and criteria for machine consciousness. For each type, the specific research contents and future developments are discussed in detail. Especially, the machine implementations of three influential consciousness theories, i.e. global workspace theory, integrated information theory and higher-order theory, are elaborated in depth. Moreover, the challenges and outlook of machine consciousness are analyzed in detail from both theoretical and technical perspectives, with emphasis on new methods and technologies that have the potential to realize machine consciousness, such as brain-inspired computing, quantum computing and hybrid intelligence. The ethical implications of machine consciousness are also discussed. Finally, a comprehensive implementation framework of machine consciousness is provided, integrating five suggested research perspectives: consciousness theories, computational methods, cognitive architectures, experimental systems, and test platforms, paving the way for the future developments of machine consciousness. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",Qin R.; Zhou C.; He M.,10.1016/j.inffus.2025.102994,2025,Article,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,
Encoding Genetic and Structural Information in DNA Using Electric Field Gradients and Nuclear Spins,"Nuclear electric resonance (NER) offers a method of controlling nuclear spins using electric field gradients (EFGs), which is a critical concept in quantum computing. In this study, we focus on nitrogen atoms in DNA, which have a nuclear spin of 1 and are influenced by EFGs. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, quantum chemical computations, and theoretical analyses, we studied the characteristics of EFGs in the context of DNA. Our results show that the orientation patterns of the EFGs at the positions of nitrogen atoms in DNA bases vary with different types of bases and nitrogen atom sites. Consequently, the genetic and structural information of DNA is encoded into the direction of the nitrogen nuclear spins. Furthermore, the interaction and evolution of these nitrogen nuclear spins with surrounding nuclear spins suggest the potential for quantum computing of genetic information. Our findings not only provide new insights into quantum phenomena in biological systems but also lay the groundwork for expanding the theoretical foundations of DNA quantum computing and offer innovative approaches for the design of future biocompatible quantum computers. © 2024 Yu Zheng and Quansheng Ren.",Zheng Y.; Ren Q.,10.34133/icomputing.0094,2024,Article,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,
A Quantum Annealing Instance Selection Approach for Efficient and Effective Transformer Fine-Tuning,"Deep Learning approaches have become pervasive in recent years due to their ability to solve complex tasks. However, these models need huge datasets for proper training and good generalization. This translates into high training and fine-tuning time, even several days for the most complex models and large datasets. In this work, we present a novel quantum Instance Selection (IS) approach that allows to significantly reduce the size of the training datasets (by up to 28%) while maintaining the model's effectiveness, thus promoting (training) speedups and scalability. Our solution is innovative in the sense that it exploits a different computing paradigm - Quantum Annealing (QA) - a specific Quantum Computing paradigm that can be used to tackle optimization problems. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no prior attempts to tackle the IS problem using QA. Furthermore, we propose a new Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation specific for the IS problem, which is a contribution in itself. Through an extensive set of experiments with several Text Classification benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate our quantum solution's feasibility and competitiveness with the current state-of-the-art IS solutions. © 2024 Owner/Author.",Pasin A.; Cunha W.; Gonçalves M.A.; Ferro N.,10.1145/3664190.3672515,2024,Conference paper,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,
Ideal Parametrisation Estimation for Variational Quantum Circuit Classifiers Using Machine Learning,"Quantum neural network implementation through variational quantum circuits is getting attention due to their applicability to the existing quantum computer technology and significant model parameters reduction. This paper considers the problem of automatically transforming existing neural networks into corresponding variational quantum circuits. In particular, given a trained neural network, the paper considers estimating the number of ansatz layers so that the corresponding circuit is not over or under-parametrized. This is achieved by constructing a dataset containing many trained neural networks each labelled with the corresponding optimal number of variational quantum layers, obtained through experimentation. The paper further performs dataset augmentation using an LLM model to speed up dataset construction. The paper then selects a set of features based on both the network architecture and the trained parameters, and then trains a feed-forward neural network. The trained network achieves 86.7% accuracy on unseen unaugmented test circuits. © 2024 IEEE.",Fathi M.; Gomaa W.; Wada Y.; Kimura K.; Ueda K.; El-Mahdy A.,10.1109/QCE60285.2024.10263,2024,Conference paper,Scopus,Aceito,,,"Cria um dataset para parametrização de numero de camadas para que um circuito quantico nao seja subparametrizado ou excessivamente parametrizado, usa um LLM para fazer data augmentation.",,,

Large scale structure-aware pronoun resolution using quantum natural language processing,"Natural language consists of words, sentences, and larger units. Guided by grammatical structure, words compose with each other to form sentences. Similarly, guided by discourse structure, sentences compose with each other to form dialogues and documents. Classical machine learning algorithms have achieved significant success in learning the meanings of words. When it comes to meanings of sentences and discourse units, they however fall short of being compositional. The DisCoCat model of meaning, introduced by Clark, Coecke, and Sadrzadeh in 2010, provides a solution—at the sentence level—using higher-order tensors, the learning of which has been a challenge. A recent initiative known as Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) introduces a translation between the DisCoCat tensors and Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC). This offers the potential of learning these higher-order tensors more efficiently when the circuits are executed on quantum computers. In previous work, we lifted the DisCoCat framework from the sentence level to the discourse level using a Fock space semantics. In this paper, we extend the DisCoCat-VQC translation to this semantics and experiment with it in a discourse task. We develop a massive dataset with 16,400 entries inspired by a major coreference resolution task, known as the Winograd Schema Challenge, proposed as a test of machine intelligence. Noisy and noiseless simulations were executed on IBMQ software, and the parameters of the discourse VQCs were learnt. The model converged to 77.5% accuracy, surpassing a Bag-of-Words model that neglects any structure. It also outperformed 2 out of 3 state-of-the-art classical coreference resolution architectures.

Applying Variational Quantum Classifier on Acceptability Judgements: A QNLP Experiment,"The newborn Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) field has experienced tremendous growth in recent years. The possibility of applying quantum mechanics to critical aspects of language processing has dramatically impacted many tasks, ranging from theoretical approaches to algorithms implemented on real quantum hardware. From a methodological point of view, the possibility offered by applying quantum mechanics to NLP problems is well suited to classification tasks. This work aims to test the potential computational advantages of a hybrid algorithm, namely the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), to perform classification on a classical Linguistics task: acceptability judgments. VQC is a quantum machine learning algorithm able to infer the relations between input features and the associated belonging class using a parametrized quantum circuit and an encoding layer that embeds classical data into quantum states. An acceptability judgment is defined as the ability to determine whether a sentence is considered as natural and well-formed by a native speaker. The approach has been tested on sentences extracted from ItaCoLa, a corpus that collects Italian sentences labeled with their acceptability judgment.

Quantum space-efficient large language models for Prolog query translation,"As large language models (LLMs) continue to expand in complexity, their size follows an exponential increase following Moore’s law. However, implementing such complex tasks with LLMs poses a significant challenge, as classical computers may lack the necessary space to run or store the model parameters. In this context leveraging the principles of hybrid quantum machine learning for language models offers a promising solution to mitigate this issue by reducing storage space for model parameters. Although pure quantum language models have demonstrated success in recent past, they are constrained by limited features and availability. In this research we propose the DeepKet model an approach with a quantum embedding layer, which utilizes the Hilbert space generated by quantum entanglement to store feature vectors, leading to a significant reduction in size. The experimental analysis evaluates the performance of open-source pre-trained models like Microsoft Phi and CodeGen, specifically fine-tuned for generating Prolog code for geo-spatial data retrieval.

This work shows potential advantages, in terms of both performance and expressiveness, of quantum transfer learning algorithms trained on embedding vectors extracted from a large language model to perform classification on a classical linguistics task—acceptability judgements. Acceptability judgement is the ability to determine whether a sentence is considered natural and well-formed by a native speaker.

Enhanced quantum long short-term memory by using bidirectional ring variational quantum circuit,"With the rapid development of quantum machine learning, the Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) has been found to exhibit faster convergence characteristics in time series prediction problems. Currently, it has found applications in fields such as financial market analysis, natural language processing, and weather forecasting, but its accuracy in regression problem prediction still shows deficiencies. To improve the prediction accuracy of the model, enhanced quantum long short-term memory by using bidirectional ring variational quantum circuit (EQLSTM) is proposed. We reconsidered and optimized the types, quantities, and arrangements of quantum gates, designing a bidirectional ring variational quantum circuit composed of CRX gates (Bi-VQC) to enhance its expressibility. Bi-VQC can more accurately describe and encode complex quantum state features, enabling the EQLSTM to better learn and represent the characteristics of the input data. In addition, Bi-VQC reduces the number of optimizable parameters and lowers the circuit load of the EQLSTM model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, experiments are conducted to test and evaluate the EQLSTM using the aggregated traffic in the UK academic network backbone.

Training Quantum Self-Attention Model in Near-Term Quantum Computer,"Quantum computing is rapidly emerging as a revolutionary computing paradigm with significant development potential. Variational quantum algorithms, especially those employing variational quantum circuits, have demonstrated notable advantages in domains including finance, chemistry, and machine learning. However, the practical deployment of these algorithms on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices faces challenges due to quantum noise, state collapse, and limited qubits numbers. The real-world performance of these algorithms remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing and implementing a novel method for training quantum self-attention model for text classification directly on quantum computing chips. This initiative marks the first instance of employing such models on actual quantum hardware. Our approach optimizes quantum circuit designs to mitigate the impact of quantum noise and introduces parallel training strategies to enhance efficiency. Our experiments, conducted on the 'Wukong' superconducting 72-qubit quantum computer, demonstrate that our models can be effectively trained on real quantum hardware. The results from the actual quantum chips slightly outperformed those from simulators, confirming the practical feasibility of applying quantum self-attention model to natural language processing tasks.

We grouped CAE-CD KUs into those required as prerequisites, closely related, related/supported, and not covered by the E-voting curriculum. Teachers can then choose which KUs they will use and teach using only the parts of the E-voting-oriented curriculum they deem relevant, and in a depth they find appropriate to their educational objectives, while meeting the requirements of the selected KUs. We conclude with a discussion of how LLMs (Large Language Models) and quantum computing might be added to the E-voting-oriented curriculum. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Sanchez E.A.; Zheng M.; Bishop M.; Zou X.,10.1145/3641554.3701960,2025,Conference paper,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,

LLM-generated tips rival expert-created tips in helping students answer quantum-computing questions,"Alleviating high workloads for teachers is crucial for continuous high quality education. To evaluate if Large Language Models (LLMs) can alleviate this problem in the quantum computing domain, we conducted two complementary studies exploring the use of GPT-4 to automatically generate tips for students. (1) A between-subject survey in which students (N = 46) solved four multiple-choice quantum computing questions with either the help of expert-created or LLMgenerated tips. To correct for possible biases, we additionally introduced two deception conditions. (2) Experienced educators and students (N = 23) directly compared the LLM-generated and expert-created tips. Our results show that the LLM-generated tips were significantly more helpful and pointed better towards relevant concepts while also giving away more of the answers. Furthermore, we found that participants in the first study performed significantly better in answering the quantum computing questions when given tips labeled as LLM-generated, even if they were expert-created. This points towards a placebo effect induced by the participants’ biases for LLM-generated content. Ultimately, we contribute that LLM-generated tips can be used instead of expert tips to support teaching of quantum computing basics. © The Author(s) 2025.",Krupp L.; Bley J.; Gobbi I.; Geng A.; Müller S.; Suh S.; Moghiseh A.; Castaneda Medina A.; Bartsch V.; Widera A.; Ott H.; Lukowicz P.; Karolus J.; Kiefer-Emmanouilidis M.,10.1140/epjqt/s40507-025-00334-5,2025,Article,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,
Multi-scale feature fusion quantum depthwise Convolutional Neural Networks for text classification,"In recent years, with the development of quantum machine learning, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) have gained increasing attention in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have achieved a series of promising results. However, most existing QNN models focus on the architectures of Quantum Recurrent Neural Network (QRNN) and Quantum Self-Attention Mechanism (QSAM). In this work, we propose a novel QNN model based on quantum convolution. We develop the quantum depthwise convolution that significantly reduces the number of parameters and lowers computational complexity. We also introduce the multi-scale feature fusion mechanism to enhance model performance by integrating word-level and sentence-level features. Additionally, we propose the quantum word embedding and quantum sentence embedding, which provide embedding vectors more efficiently. Through experiments on two benchmark text classification datasets, we demonstrate our model outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art QNN models. Notably, our model achieves a new state-of-the-art test accuracy of 96.77% on the RP dataset. We also show the advantages of our quantum model over its classical counterparts in its ability to improve test accuracy using fewer parameters.

Hierarchical graph contrastive learning framework based on quantum neural networks for sentiment analysis,"Existing multi-modal sentiment analysis (MSA) methods typically achieve interaction by connecting different layers or designing special structures, but rarely consider the synergistic effects among data. Moreover, most sentiment analysis research tends to focus solely on single sentiment polarity analysis, without considering the intensity and directional attributes of emotions. Addressing these issues, we propose a framework called Hierarchical Graph Contrastive Learning based on Quantum Neural Network (HGCL-QNN) to remedy these shortcomings. Specifically, a graph structure is established within and between modalities. In the quantum fuzzy neural network module, fuzzy quantum encoding is implemented by using complex-valued, then quantum superposition and entanglement are utilized to consider the intensity and directional attributes of emotions while analyzing emotional polarity. In the quantum multi-modal fusion neural network module, methods such as amplitude encoding and quantum entanglement are employed to further integrate information from different modalities, thereby enhancing the model's power to express emotional information. To enhance the model's understanding of fine-grained and global features, and to better align and integrate features from different modalities, hierarchical graph contrastive learning is employed on different levels. The experimental results demonstrate that HGCL-QNN outperforms the existing baseline methods on MOSI and MOSEI datasets, achieving significant efficacy improvements. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Jia K.; Meng F.; Liang J.,10.1016/j.ins.2024.121543,2025,Article,Scopus,Rejeitado,Data de publicação fora do intervalo,,"Propôe um novo framework que usa conceitos quânicos, chamado HGCL-QNN, que atua na tarefa de classificação de sentimentos multimodal, revelando o sentimento e sua intensidade.",,,
What ChatGPT Has to Say About Its Topological Structure: The Anyon Hypothesis,"Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable predictive capabilities but remain opaque in their internal reasoning, creating a pressing need for more interpretable artificial intelligence. Here, we propose bridging this explanatory gap by drawing on concepts from topological quantum computing (TQC), specifically the anyonic frameworks arising from (Formula presented.) theories. Anyons interpolate between fermions and bosons, offering a mathematical language that may illuminate the latent structure and decision-making processes within LLMs. By examining how these topological constructs relate to token interactions and contextual dependencies in neural architectures, we aim to provide a fresh perspective on how meaning and coherence emerge. After eliciting insights from ChatGPT and exploring low-level cases of (Formula presented.) models, we argue that the machinery of modular tensor categories and topological phases could inform more transparent, stable, and robust AI systems.

Hybrid classical-quantum transfer learning for text classification,"Quantum machine learning (QML) is a promising field that combines the power of quantum computing with machine learning. Variational quantum circuits, where parameters of circuits are learned classically, have been widely used in many recent applications of QML. This is an instance of a hybrid quantum-classical framework, where both classical and quantum components are present. However, applying these techniques to applications involving massive data is a challenging task. One way to overcome this, is using the concept of classical-quantum transfer learning with the help of a dressed quantum circuit, introduced recently, where the underlying neural architecture is pre-trained classically, but at the final steps (decision layer), a quantum circuit is used, followed by quantum measurements and post-processing to classify images with high precision. In this paper, we applied hybrid classical-quantum transfer learning to another task of massive data processing, i.e., natural language processing (NLP). We show how to (binary) classify short texts (e.g., SMS) with classical-quantum transfer learning, which was originally applied to image processing only. Our quantum network uses pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers (BERT) model, and its variational quantum circuit is fine-tuned for text processing. We evaluated the performance of our hybrid neural architecture using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which is typically used in the evaluation of classification problems. The results indicate high precision as well as lower loss function. To our knowledge, our work is the first application of quantum transfer learning to the area of NLP.

Classical-quantum hybrid transfer learning for adverse drug reaction detection from social media posts,"Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) is a threat to human beings, sometimes it causes death. Thus, the detection of ADRs is crucial. This paper introduces a classical-quantum hybrid deep learning model for detecting adverse drug effects from social media reviews (in English). The suggested methodology improvises the ability to grasp human language for identifying pharmacological side effects of a drug. This article aims to combine the features of traditional machine learning methods to quantum computing into a single framework.

Explainable hybrid quantum neural networks for analyzing the influence of tweets on stock price prediction,"Stock price prediction is a complex and challenging activity for organizations and investors to predict future returns. While machine learning and deep learning methods are widely used for stock closing price prediction, these methods have some drawbacks, including high scalability, slow convergence, and poor generalization performance. Furthermore, because those models are inherently black-box, it is challenging to comprehend the logic underlying their forecasts. This study presents an explainable hybrid quantum neural network to investigate the influence of tweets on a stock price prediction. The datasets used in this analysis include the stock prices of six different organizations as well as the 4 million+ tweets written on X (previously Twitter). The proposed methodology finds the average sentiment score of daily tweets using a transformer model which is combined with historical stock data. The proposed hybrid genetic algorithm based quantum neural network predicts the future stock closing price more accurately and uses explainable artificial intelligence methods to investigate the influence of average sentiment score of tweets and compute each attribute contribution towards the outcome. The proposed hybrid quantum neural network outperforms the other existing classical machine learning and quantum inspired machine learning algorithms by achieving a model accuracy (R2) greater than 99% in the prediction of stock prices for the six different organizations. Further, based on the explainability analysis, we observe that the tweets do not influence stock price to a greater extent. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Gandhudi M.; P.J.A. A.; Fiore U.; G.R.

A light-weight quantum self-attention model for classical data classification,"As an interdisciplinary field combining quantum computation and machine learning, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has shown the potential to outperform classical machine learning on some algorithms. Given that the transformer, with self-attention as its core mechanism, has become a popular backbone model in the field of machine learning, the exploration of a quantum version of the self-attention mechanism has become an intriguing topic. In this paper, we propose a Quantum Self-Attention Model (QSAM) based on Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA), aiming to combine the advantages of quantum neural network and self-attention together. To implement the self-attention mechanism on quantum neural network, we employ parameterized quantum circuits to learn the features of input data in quantum-enhanced spaces, then introduce the innovative Amplitude-Phase Decomposition Measurement (APDM) to obtain the essential components of self-attention model: query, key and value. By introducing APDM, we can implement the quantum self-attention model with a lower parameter quantity than that of previous methods, making our QSAM have a better deployability on near-term quantum devices. We apply QSAM on both NLP and CV datasets for binary and multiple classification. The results show that our QSAM outperforms its classical counterpart and is as good as the state-of-the-art quantum self-attention model on NLP datasets.

Recognizing beam profiles from silicon photonics gratings using a transformer model,"Over the past decade, there has been extensive work in developing integrated silicon photonics (SiPh) gratings for the optical addressing of trapped ion qubits among the ion trap quantum computing community. However, when viewing beam profiles from gratings using infrared (IR) cameras, it is often difficult to determine the corresponding heights where the beam profiles are located. In this work, we developed transformer models to recognize the corresponding height categories of beam profiles in light from SiPh gratings. The models are trained using two techniques: (1) input patches and (2) input sequence. For the model trained with input patches, the model achieved a recognition accuracy of 0.924. Meanwhile, the model trained with input sequence shows a lower accuracy of 0.892. However, when repeating the model training for 150 cycles, a model trained with input patches shows inconsistent accuracy ranges between 0.289 to 0.959, while the model trained with input sequence shows accuracy values between 0.75 to 0.947.

Quantum-Inspired Data Embedding for Unlabeled Data in Sparse Environments: A Theoretical Framework for Improved Semi-Supervised Learning without Hardware Dependence,"This paper introduces an innovative theoretical framework for quantum-inspired data embeddings, grounded in foundational concepts of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement. This approach aims to advance semi-supervised learning in contexts characterized by limited labeled data by enabling more intricate and expressive embeddings that capture the underlying structure of the data effectively. Grounded in foundational quantum mechanics concepts such as superposition and entanglement, this approach redefines data representation by enabling more intricate and expressive embeddings. Emulating quantum superposition encodes each data point as a probabilistic amalgamation of multiple feature states, facilitating a richer, multidimensional representation of underlying structures and patterns. Additionally, quantum-inspired entanglement mechanisms are harnessed to model intricate dependencies between labeled and unlabeled data, promoting enhanced knowledge transfer and structural inference within the learning paradigm. In contrast to conventional quantum machine learning methodologies that often rely on quantum hardware, this framework is fully realizable within classical computational architectures, thus bypassing the practical limitations of quantum hardware. The versatility of this model is illustrated through its application to critical domains such as medical diagnosis, resource-constrained natural language processing, and financial forecasting—areas where data scarcity impedes the efficacy of traditional models. Experimental evaluations reveal that quantum-inspired embeddings substantially outperform standard approaches, enhancing model resilience and generalization in high-dimensional, low-sample scenarios. This research marks a significant stride in integrating quantum theoretical principles with classical machine learning, broadening the scope of data representation and semi-supervised learning while circumventing the technological barriers of quantum computing infrastructure. © 2024, Sakarya University.

Exploring LLM-Driven Explanations for Quantum Algorithms,"Background: Quantum computing is a rapidly growing new programming paradigm that brings significant changes to the design and implementation of algorithms. Understanding quantum algorithms requires knowledge of physics and mathematics, which can be challenging for software developers. Aims: In this work, we provide a first analysis of how LLMs can support developers' understanding of quantum code. Method: We empirically analyse and compare the quality of explanations provided by three widely adopted LLMs (Gpt3.5, Llama2, and Tinyllama) using two different human-written prompt styles for seven state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. We also analyse how consistent LLM explanations are over multiple rounds and how LLMs can improve existing descriptions of quantum algorithms. Results: Llama2 provides the highest quality explanations from scratch, while Gpt3.5 emerged as the LLM best suited to improve existing explanations. In addition, we show that adding a small amount of context to the prompt significantly improves the quality of explanations. Finally, we observe how explanations are qualitatively and syntactically consistent over multiple rounds. Conclusions: This work highlights promising results, and opens challenges for future research in the field of LLMs for quantum code explanation. Future work includes refining the methods through prompt optimisation and parsing of quantum code explanations, as well as carrying out a systematic assessment of the quality of explanations.  © 2024 Owner/Author.",D'Aloisio G.; Fortz S.; Hanna C.; Fortunato D.; Bensoussan A.; Mendiluze Usandizaga E.; Sarro F.,10.1145/3674805.3690753,2024,Conference paper,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,

Quantum Transfer Learning for Sentiment Analysis: an experiment on an Italian corpus,"Exploiting quantum properties to improve performance of different tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other domains has increasingly becoming a successful trend to deal complex language phenomena or to fill task or domain-specific gaps with an approach that needs less data and minor computational resources. The field that has, to date, yielded more quantum-based attention is the retrieval and classification of textual data. This work aims to replicate the excellent results of hybrid quantum approaches for syntactic tasks on semantic classification tasks. In detail, a quantum machine learning algorithm, namely, the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), is used to perform sentiment analysis classification tasks. This algorithm can deduce the relationships between input features and their corresponding class affiliations using a parametrized quantum circuit and an encoding layer that translates classical data into quantum states. The approach has been tested on a well-known benchmark annotated dataset used for the Italian language, and the results have been compared to existing baselines, pointing out state-of-the-art scores. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",Buonaiuto G.; Guarasci R.; Esposito M.,10.1145/3660318.3660325,2024,Conference paper,Scopus,Aceito,,,"O artigo explora o uso de propriedades quânticas para melhorar tarefas de NLP, focando em classificação semântica.

Quantifying the performance of quantum machine learning algorithms for heart valve detection using H-Bert classifier,"This chapter reveals the strategy to determine the effectiveness of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) algorithms to work in the healthcare field, specifically when it comes to finding problems with heart valves. Mostly, many organizations are using the major advanced features of quantum computing technologies and hence there is some need in analyzing the features and implication strategies of Quantum computing. In this chapter, an advanced version of the H-Bert Classifier is applied to the Quantum framework for finding the various problems related to the heart. Normally 14 important variables are used from the dataset for determining the heart valves. H-Bert classifier is used here for improving the accuracy rate of classification. To maintain maximum accuracy some of the quantum computing algorithms like Quantum Logistic Regression (QLR), Quantum Nearest Neighbor (QKNN), and Quantum Linear Discriminant Analysis (QLDA) are used. The most complicated patterns in the dataset are determined effectively by using the Quantum computation mechanism with the H-Bert classifier. To normalize the obtained values while processing some advanced methods like principal component analysis (PCA), min-max scaling, and standard scalar methods, are used. H-Bert combines BERT classifier in addition to Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (BiLSTM). Then for making the detection process very accurate and sensitive minor details of the heart valve are to be picked out. The H-Bert Classifier with Quantum ensemble will do the process effectively and accurately. The entire implementation process is a sequential, step-by-step procedure. This pipeline process will make the scheme more efficient and performance-driven. Compared to the traditional machine learning algorithms the detection of heart valves is done most effectively by using this quantum algorithm. The improvement in the accuracy is guaranteed by the quantum algorithms in the determination of heart health diagnostics. Another advantage of using this hybrid methodology is its effectiveness in handling the computational cost. Especially in dealing with real-time parameters, it took very less time during execution. The study sheds light on the best ways to use quantum algorithms in healthcare and gives useful insights into the quantifiable benefits of using quantum machine learning for detecting heart valves. A major step forward in the efficient and accurate diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities has been the introduction of the H-Bert classifier in quantum machine learning. Both medical research and patient care stand to benefit substantially from this new development. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology and its licensors 2024.",Suresh Kumar K.; Ananth Kumar T.; Hu Y.-C.; Nishanth R.,10.1049/PBHE060E_ch14,2024,Book chapter,Scopus,Rejeitado,Tipo de arquivo incorreto,,,,,
Quantum Algorithms for Compositional Text Processing,"Quantum computing and AI have found a fruitful intersection in the field of natural language processing. We focus on the recently proposed DisCoCirc framework for natural language, and propose a quantum adaptation, QDisCoCirc. This is motivated by a compositional approach to rendering AI interpretable: the behavior of the whole can be understood in terms of the behavior of parts, and the way they are put together. For the model-native primitive operation of text similarity, we derive quantum algorithms for fault-tolerant quantum computers to solve the task of question-answering within QDisCoCirc, and show that this is BQP-hard; note that we do not consider the complexity of question-answering in other natural language processing models. Assuming widely-held conjectures, implementing the proposed model classically would require super-polynomial resources. Therefore, it could provide a meaningful demonstration of the power of practical quantum processors. The model construction builds on previous work in compositional quantum natural language processing. Word embeddings are encoded as parameterized quantum circuits, and compositionality here means that the quantum circuits compose according to the linguistic structure of the text. We outline a method for evaluating the model on near-term quantum processors, and elsewhere we report on a recent implementation of this on quantum hardware. In addition, we adapt a quantum algorithm for the closest vector problem to obtain a Grover-like speedup in the fault-tolerant regime for our model. This provides an unconditional quadratic speedup over any classical algorithm in certain circumstances, which we will verify empirically in future work. © T. Laakkonen, K. Meichanetzidis, B.

LLM-Resilient Bibliometrics: Factual Consistency Through Entity Triplet Extraction,"The increase in power and availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) since late 2022 led to increased concerns with their usage to automate academic paper mills. In turn, this poses a threat to bibliometrics-based technology monitoring and forecasting in rapidly moving fields. We propose to address this issue by leveraging semantic entity triplets. Specifically, we extract factual statements from scientific papers and represent them as (subject, predicate, object) triplets before validating the factual consistency of statements within and between scientific papers. This approach heavily penalizes blind usage of stochastic text generators such as LLMs while not penalizing authors who used LLMs solely to improve the readability of their paper. Here, we present a pipeline to extract such triplets and compare them. While our pipeline is promising and sensitive enough to detect inconsistencies between papers from different domains, the intra-paper entity reference resolution needs to be improved to ensure that triplets are more specific. We believe that our pipeline will be useful to the general research community working on the factual consistency of scientific texts. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",Sternfeld A.; Kucharavy A.; David D.P.; Mermoud A.; Jang-Jaccard J.,,2024,Conference paper,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,

A Quantum Annealing-Based Instance Selection Approach for Transformer Fine-Tuning,"Currently, Deep Learning (DL) is widely used to solve very complex tasks. However, the training of DL models requires huge datasets and long training times. We introduce a novel quantum Instance Selection (IS) approach that reduces training dataset sizes by up to 28% while maintaining effectiveness, enhancing training efficiency and scalability. Our method leverages Quantum Annealing (QA), a specific Quantum Computing paradigm, that can address optimization problems. This is the first attempt to tackle the IS problem using QA, and we propose a new Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation for it.

Toward Designing High-Speed Cost-Efficient Quantum Reversible Carry Select Adders,"Compared to classical computing implementations, reversible arithmetic adders offer a valuable platform for implementing quantum computation models in digital systems and specific applications, such as cryptography and natural language processing.

Quantum computing and machine learning for Arabic language sentiment classification in social media,"With the increasing amount of digital data generated by Arabic speakers, the need for effective and efficient document classification techniques is more important than ever. In recent years, both quantum computing and machine learning have shown great promise in the field of document classification. However, there is a lack of research investigating the performance of these techniques on the Arabic language. This paper presents a comparative study of quantum computing and machine learning for two datasets of Arabic language document classification. In the first dataset of 213,465 Arabic tweets, both classic machine learning (ML) and quantum computing approaches achieve high accuracy in sentiment analysis, with quantum computing slightly outperforming classic ML. Quantum computing completes the task in approximately 59 min, slightly faster than classic ML, which takes around 1 h. The precision, recall, and F1 score metrics indicate the effectiveness of both approaches in predicting sentiment in Arabic tweets. Classic ML achieves precision, recall, and F1 score values of 0.8215, 0.8175, and 0.8121, respectively, while quantum computing achieves values of 0.8239, 0.8199, and 0.8147, respectively. In the second dataset of 44,000 tweets, both classic ML (using the Random Forest algorithm) and quantum computing demonstrate significantly reduced processing times compared to the first dataset, with no substantial difference between them. Classic ML completes the analysis in approximately 2 min, while quantum computing takes approximately 1 min and 53 s. The accuracy of classic ML is higher at 0.9241 compared to 0.9205 for quantum computing. However, both approaches achieve high precision, recall, and F1 scores, indicating their effectiveness in accurately predicting sentiment in the dataset. Classic ML achieves precision, recall, and F1 score values of 0.9286, 0.9241, and 0.9249, respectively, while quantum computing achieves values of 0.92456, 0.9205, and 0.9214, respectively.

Exploring the Capabilities and Limitations of VQC and QSVC for Sentiment Analysis on Real-World and Synthetic Datasets,"This study conducts a comparative analysis of two quantum classifiers, namely the Quantum Support Vector Classifier (QSVC) and the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), within the framework of sentiment analysis on both real-world and synthetic datasets.

QDoor: Exploiting Approximate Synthesis for Backdoor Attacks in Quantum Neural Networks,"Quantum neural networks (QNNs) succeed in object recognition, natural language processing, and financial analysis. To maximize the accuracy of a QNN on a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computer, approximate synthesis modifies the QNN circuit by reducing error-prone 2-qubit quantum gates. The success of QNNs motivates adversaries to attack QNNs via backdoors. However, naively transplanting backdoors designed for classical neural networks to QNNs yields only low attack success rate, due to the noises and approximate synthesis on NISQ computers. Prior quantum circuit-based backdoors cannot selectively attack some inputs or work with all types of encoding layers of a QNN circuit. Moreover, it is easy to detect both transplanted and circuit-based backdoors in a QNN. In this paper, we propose a novel and stealthy backdoor attack, QDoor, to achieve high attack success rate in approximately-synthesized QNN circuits by weaponizing unitary differences between uncompiled QNNs and their synthesized counterparts. QDoor trains a QNN behaving normally for all inputs with and without a trigger. However, after approximate synthesis, the QNN circuit always predicts any inputs with a trigger to a predefined class while still acts normally for benign inputs. Compared to prior backdoor attacks, QDoor improves the attack success rate by 13x and the clean data accuracy by 65% on average. Furthermore, prior backdoor detection techniques cannot find QDoor attacks in uncompiled QNN circuits. © 2023 IEEE.",Chu C.; Chen F.; Richerme P.; Jiang L.,10.1109/QCE57702.2023.00124,2023,Conference paper,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,

Using Quantum Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Classification and Next-Word Prediction in Sentences Without Fixed Syntactic Structure,"Quantum Computing is envisioned as one of the scientific areas with greater transformative potential. Already there exist applications running in quantum devices for different areas, like cybersecurity, chemistry, or machine learning.

Towards Transparency in Coreference Resolution: A Quantum-Inspired Approach,"Guided by grammatical structure, words compose to form sentences, and guided by discourse structure, sentences compose to form dialogues and documents. The compositional aspect of sentence and discourse units is often overlooked by machine learning algorithms. A recent initiative called Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) learns word meanings as points in a Hilbert space and acts on them via a translation of grammatical structure into Parametrised Quantum Circuits (PQCs). Previous work extended the QNLP translation to discourse structure using points in a closure of Hilbert spaces. In this paper, we evaluate this translation on a Winograd-style pronoun resolution task. We train a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) for binary classification and implement an end-to-end pronoun resolution system. The simulations executed on IBMQ software converged with an F1 score of 87.20%. The model outperformed two out of three classical coreference resolution systems and neared state-of-the-art SpanBERT.

Grammar-aware sentence classification on quantum computers,"Natural language processing (NLP) is at the forefront of great advances in contemporary AI, and it is arguably one of the most challenging areas of the field. At the same time, in the area of quantum computing (QC), with the steady growth of quantum hardware and notable improvements towards implementations of quantum algorithms, we are approaching an era when quantum computers perform tasks that cannot be done on classical computers with a reasonable amount of resources. This provides an new range of opportunities for AI, and for NLP specifically. In this work, we work with the Categorical Distributional Compositional (DisCoCat) model of natural language meaning, whose underlying mathematical underpinnings make it amenable to quantum instantiations. Earlier work on fault-tolerant quantum algorithms has already demonstrated potential quantum advantage for NLP, notably employing DisCoCat. In this work, we focus on the capabilities of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware and perform the first implementation of an NLP task on a NISQ processor, using the DisCoCat framework. Sentences are instantiated as parameterised quantum circuits; word-meanings are embedded in quantum states using parameterised quantum-circuits and the sentence’s grammatical structure faithfully manifests as a pattern of entangling operations which compose the word-circuits into a sentence-circuit. The circuits’ parameters are trained using a classical optimiser in a supervised NLP task of binary classification.

Qiskit Code Assistant: Training LLMs for generating Quantum Computing Code,"Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools, revolutionizing the software development landscape by automating the coding process and reducing time and effort required to build applications. This paper focuses on training Code LLMs to specialize in the field of quantum computing.

A Code LLM specializing in quantum computing requires a foundational understanding of quantum computing and quantum information theory. However, the scarcity of available quantum code examples and the rapidly evolving field, which necessitates continuous dataset updates, present significant challenges. Moreover, we discuss our work on training Code LLMs to produce high-quality quantum code using the Qiskit library. This work includes an examination of the various aspects of the LLMs used for training and the specific training conditions, as well as the results obtained with our current models. To evaluate our models, we have developed a custom benchmark, similar to HumanEval, which includes a set of tests specifically designed for the field of quantum computing programming using Qiskit.

Simple Sentiment Analysis Ansatz for Sentiment Classification in Quantum Natural Language Processing,"Sentiment classification is a valuable application of natural language processing that has seen wide usage in optimizing business processes. This paper explores a novel implementation of sentiment analysis using the Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) framework. As ansatz choice determines model performance in VQA, this paper proposes an alternative ansatz for the sentiment classification task in quantum representation. Specifically, it builds upon previous work in quantum sentiment classification by proposing an alternative ansatz to the Instantaneous Quantum Polytime ansatz, entitled Simple Sentiment Analysis (SimpleSA) ansatz. A key feature of the SimpleSA ansatz is the decision to neglect noun parameterization. The proposed SimpleSA has less complexity than the other ansätze in terms of the number of parameters and the number of gates. Moreover, experimental results show that the SimpleSA ansatz with H-CNOT-Rz-H compound block construction outperforms the Instantaneous Quantum Polytime (IQP) ansatz at 85.00% accuracy. Furthermore, SimpleSA optimization converges 20.89% faster than Instantaneous Quantum Polytime (IQP) for the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) method with 130 iterations.

Natural language processing, synthesis, and multimodal data fusion have all been significantly aided by these models, which are based on deep learning architectures.

"Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network for Multimodal Multitask Sarcasm, Emotion, and Sentiment Analysis","Sarcasm detection in unimodal or multimodal setting is a very complex task. Sarcasm, emotion, and sentiment are related to each other, and hence any multitask model could be an effective way to leverage the interdependence among these tasks. In order to better represent these clandestine associations, we avoid solely relying on traditional machine learning methods to encode the relationships between the modalities. In this article, we propose a hybrid quantum model that banks upon the low computational complexity and robust representational power of a variational quantum circuit (VQC) and the tried and tested dense neural network to tackle sentiment, emotion, and sarcasm classification simultaneously. We empirically establish that the quantum properties like superposition, entanglement, and interference will better capture and replicate not only the cross-modal interactions between text, acoustics, and visuals but also the correlations between the three responses.

Quantum-Inspired Fully Complex-Valued Neutral Network for Sentiment Analysis,"Most of the existing quantum-inspired models are based on amplitude-phase embedding to model natural language, which maps words into Hilbert space. In quantum-computing theory, the vectors corresponding to quantum states are all complex values, so there is a gap between these two areas. Presently, complex-valued neural networks have been studied, but their practical applications are few, let alone in the downstream tasks of natural language processing such as sentiment analysis and language modeling. In fact, the complex-valued neural network can use the imaginary part information to embed hidden information and can express more complex information, which is suitable for modeling complex natural language. Meanwhile, quantum-inspired models are defined in Hilbert space, which is also a complex space. So it is natural to construct quantum-inspired models based on complex-valued neural networks. Therefore, we propose a new quantum-inspired model for NLP, ComplexQNN, which contains a complex-valued embedding layer, a quantum encoding layer, and a measurement layer. The modules of ComplexQNN are fully based on complex-valued neural networks. It is more in line with quantum-computing theory and easier to transfer to quantum computers in the future to achieve exponential acceleration. We conducted experiments on six sentiment-classification datasets comparing with five classical models (TextCNN, GRU, ELMo, BERT, and RoBERTa).

The second dataset is extracted from well-known benchmark dataset (MADELON) - features are generated with a combination of informative, repeated and uninformative features. Both datasets are used for binary classification and multi-class classification with 3 classes. We observe robust, accurate performance from all models on the binary classification tasks, but multiclass classification is a challenge for the quantum models-there is a notable decrease in accuracy when using 3 classes.

Quantum machine learning enhancing AI with quantum computing,"Quantum circuits with certain statistical properties called t-designs allow investigations into the behavior of gradients in high dimensions, and therefore tell us something about the trainability of quantum models in regimes that cannot necessarily be simulated. Along with that, the chapter shows how quantum machine learning is being used in real-world settings in a variety of fields, such as drug discovery, financial modelling, image identification, and natural language processing. All fundamental subatomic particles fall into two classes, based on how identical particles of each type behave when swapped. They are either fermions, a class that includes electrons and other particles that make up matter, or bosons, which include particles of light known as photons. Data encoding is often the most crucial step of quantum machine learning with classical data. It illustrates the possible advantages and insights that quantum algorithms can offer to various fields and analyses the ongoing research projects aimed at converting conventional machine learning models for quantum platforms. © 2023, IGI Global.",Muthusamy A.,10.4018/978-1-6684-7535-5.ch008,2023,Book chapter,Scopus,Rejeitado,Tipo de arquivo incorreto,,,,,
A topic-aware classifier based on a hybrid quantum-classical model,"In the era of Large Language Models, there is still potential for improvement in current Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods in terms of verifiability and consistency. NLP classical approaches are computationally expensive due to their high-power consumption, computing power, and storage requirements. Another computationally efficient approach to NLP is categorical quantum mechanics, which combines grammatical structure and individual word meaning to deduce the sentence meaning. As both quantum theory and natural language use vector space to describe states which are more efficient on quantum hardware, QNLP models can achieve up to quadratic speedup over classical direct calculation methods. In recent years, there is significant progress in utilizing quantum features such as superposition and entanglement to represent linguistic meaning on quantum hardware. Earlier research work has already demonstrated QNLP’s potential quantum advantage in terms of speeding up search, enhancing classification tasks’ accuracy and providing an exponentially large quantum state space in which complex linguistic structures can be efficiently embedded. In this work, a QNLP model is used to determine if two sentences are related to the same topic or not. By comparing our QNLP model to a classical tensor network-based one, our model improved training accuracy by up to 45% and validation accuracy by 35%, respectively. The QNLP model convergence is also studied when varying: first, the problem size, second, parametrized quantum circuits used for model’s training, and last, the backend quantum simulator noise model. The experimental results show that strongly entangled ansatz designs result in fastest model convergence. © 2023, The Author(s).",Metawei M.A.; Taher M.; ElDeeb H.; Nassar S.M.,10.1007/s00521-023-08706-7,2023,Article,Scopus,Aceito,,,Este trabalho investiga o uso de um modelo de Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) para determinar se duas sentenças tratam do mesmo tópico.

Hybrid Variational Quantum Circuit with Transformer for Classifying Medical Conditions,"Reviews in the form of text available on different web-based platform, can provide very important insights analyzing the consumers behavior and their wants and needs. Such data can be used to improve the quality or assess the effectiveness of pharmaceutical product. This effort aims to assess the medical conditions of a patient by analyzing the text reviews of pharmaceutical products, and thereby increase the patient's healthcare quality. Recently new computing paradigms like quantum machine learning gained a lot of attention. However, it is not yet feasible to perform quantum operations on high dimensional data using current quantum hardware.

A quantum-like zero-shot approach for sentiment analysis in finance,"Sentiment analysis has become an indispensable tool across various domains, including political communication, marketing analytics, and finance. In the financial sector, sentiments such as confidence or fear play a pivotal role in shaping market dynamics, influencing supply and demand, and precipitating significant price fluctuations. The timely extraction of sentiment from sources like financial news articles and social media posts is crucial for devising informed investment strategies. Despite its importance, current approaches to sentiment analysis in finance have not fully harnessed the potential of emerging technologies, such as large language models (LLMs) and quantum computing models. These cutting-edge technologies have demonstrated remarkable success in other areas of natural language processing (NLP), but their application in financial sentiment analysis remains limited. This paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel quantum model for text representation, specifically designed for the financial domain. Our approach integrates this quantum representation with a vector-based representation generated by a pre-trained LLM specialized in finance. The resulting fusion of these two representations yields a more comprehensive input for an LLM, leading to a significant enhancement in the accuracy of the sentiment analysis task. We evaluate our approach through extensive experimental tests on a publicly available dataset and demonstrate that our quantum-based method outperforms state-of-the-art models on a widely recognized financial sentiment analysis benchmark.

Nuclear electric resonance for spatially resolved spin control via pulsed optical excitation in the UV-visible spectrum,"Nuclear electric resonance (NER) spectroscopy is currently experiencing a revival as a tool for nuclear spin-based quantum computing. Compared to magnetic or electric fields, local electron density fluctuations caused by changes in the atomic environment provide a much higher spatial resolution for the addressing of nuclear spins in qubit registers or within a single molecule. In this article we investigate the possibility of coherent spin control in atoms or molecules via nuclear quadrupole resonance from first principles. An abstract, time-dependent description is provided which entails and reflects on commonly applied approximations. This formalism is then used to propose a method we refer to as ""optical""nuclear electric resonance (ONER). It employs pulsed optical excitations in the UV-visible light spectrum to modulate the electric field gradient at the position of a specific nucleus of interest by periodic changes of the surrounding electron density. Possible realizations and limitations of ONER for atomically resolved spin manipulation are discussed and tested on Be9 as an atomic benchmark system via electronic structure theory. © 2023 American Physical Society.

Quantum-Accelerated Hyperparameter Tuning for Dynamic NLP Models,"In the rapidly evolving field of natural language processing (NLP), performance optimization of large-scale NLP models is crucial. Through the application of Quantum-Accelerated Hyperparameter Tuning (QAHT), this abstract introduces a novel approach to addressing this issue. Our proposed framework leverages quantum computing capabilities to dynamically optimize NLP model hyperparameters in real-time, catering to the ever-changing character of textual data streams. Traditional hyperparameter optimisation methods usually rely on laborious grid searches or random exploration, which may not be suitable for dynamic NLP jobs. Contrarily, QAHT uses Quantum Neural Network (QNN) architectures that have been specially designed for hyperparameter optimisation. These QNNs improve performance and efficacy by dynamically modifying and improving model configurations. This abstract discusses the key elements of the QAHT architecture, including real-time model deployment, adaptive learning, and continuous data stream processing. In addition to speeding up the hyperparameter optimisation process, QAHT makes sure that NLP models are still flexible and responsive to shifts in the sentiment of the data and its distribution. This method has applications beyond NLP since it provides a foundation for effectively optimising machine learning models in complex, real-time situations. As quantum computing develops, QAHT represents a promising future in machine learning, where quantum-enhanced capabilities satisfy the needs of contemporary data-driven applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V..

Application of Quantum Recurrent Neural Network in Low-Resource Language Text Classification,"Text sentiment analysis is an important task in natural language processing and has always been a hot research topic. However, in low-resource regions such as South Asia, where languages like Bengali are widely used, the research interest is relatively low compared to high-resource regions due to limited computational resources, flexible word order, and high inflectional nature of the language. With the development of quantum technology, quantum machine learning models leverage the superposition property of qubits to enhance model expressiveness and achieve faster computation compared to classical systems. To promote the development of quantum machine learning in low-resource language domains, we propose a quantum-classical hybrid architecture. This architecture utilizes a pretrained multilingual bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT) model to obtain vector representations of words and combines the proposed batch upload quantum recurrent neural network (BUQRNN) and parameter nonshared batch upload quantum recurrent neural network (PN-BUQRNN) as feature extraction models for sentiment analysis in Bengali. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed BUQRNN structure achieves a maximum accuracy improvement of 0.993% in Bengali text classification tasks while reducing average model complexity by 12%. The PN-BUQRNN structure surpasses the BUQRNN structure once again and outperforms classical architectures in certain tasks. © 2020 IEEE.",Yu W.; Yin L.; Zhang C.; Chen Y.; Liu A.X.,10.1109/TQE.2024.3373903,2024,Article,Scopus,Aceito,,,"Este estudo propõe uma arquitetura híbrida quântica-clássica para análise de sentimentos em Bengali, uma língua de baixa recursos em termos de NLP.",,,

Deep learning framework for time series classification based on multiple imaging and hybrid quantum neural networks,"Time series classification (TSC) has attracted a lot of attention for time series data mining tasks and has been applied in various fields. With the success of deep learning (DL) in computer vision recognition, people are starting to use deep learning to tackle TSC tasks. Quantum neural networks (QNN) have recently demonstrated their superiority over traditional machine learning in methods such as image processing and natural language processing, but research using quantum neural networks to handle TSC tasks has not received enough attention. Therefore, we proposed a learning framework based on multiple imaging and hybrid QNN (MIHQNN) for TSC tasks. We investigate the possibility of converting 1D time series to 2D images and classifying the converted images using hybrid QNN. We explored the differences between MIHQNN based on single time series imaging and MIHQNN based on the fusion of multiple time series imaging. Four quantum circuits were also selected and designed to study the impact of quantum circuits on TSC tasks. We tested our method on several standard datasets and achieved significant results compared to several current TSC methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of MIHQNN.

Towards Higher Abstraction Levels in Quantum Computing,"This work is a survey and a position paper towards a higher abstraction in quantum computing (QC) programming frameworks and software development kits (SDKs). Since in 2003, Peter Shor complained about the limited increase in the number of QC algorithms [19], we see an urgent need to bridge the gap between well-established classical physics and quantum physics so that approaches become more intuitive, and - hopefully - more quantum algorithms can be discovered. In service-based hybrid QC frameworks, where algorithms need to be partitioned into quantum and classical tasks, we look at the methods available and the abstractions used. For this paper we have investigated the various levels of abstraction in Silq, Qrisp, OpenQl, Qiskit, Cirq, IonQ, and Ocean, which are originated in the QC domain, as well as CUDA Quantum, rooted in the classical software domain.

Research on Time Series Prediction via Quantum Self-Attention Neural Networks; [量子自注意力神经网络的时间序列预测],"A Multi-head Quantum Self-Attention Predict Network (MQSAPN) is designed in hybrid manner, which could be used in time-series forecasting. MQSAPN comprises two components, one is the Multi-head Quantum Self-Attention (MQSA) model, and the other is the predicting Variational Quantum Circuits (pVQC). When fed with sequential inputs, the MQSA firstly computes the key, query, and value vectors corresponding to all time steps through the variational circuits, and then according to exist studies, the attention is estimated via Gaussian function. With residual link on input and multi-head features, the output of MQSA were pushed to pVQC part, which was encoded into quantum circuit again, and the prediction would be ultimately calculated out by measurements on observables. The prediction results of MQSAPN numerical experiments on atmospheric variables indicate the effectiveness of quantum self-attention, by comparison with the results of a data-reuploading VQC model with almost same amount of parameters. The accuracy of predicting is close to classic multi-head transformer model and LSTM net. To be noted, as input time window extends or the more features are adopted, the number of parameters of pVQC will also increases correspondingly, which makes the pVQC part become the bottleneck of the whole model due to ‘barren plateau’ problems during training process. © 2024 Univ. of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

Research on Patent Semantic References Recognition Method Based on Feature Knowledge Elements: Using Quantum Computing as an Example; [基于特征知识元的专利语义引用识别方法研究 ———以量子计算领域为例],"[Purpose / significance] Patent citation analysis is essential to the patent analysis. The traditional patent citation analysis only analyzes the patent data marked in the patent documents, which cannot accurately and honestly reflect the citation relationship between patents. It is difficult to reveal the technical similarity between patents accurately. Identifying patent semantic references is conducive to accurately and genuinely revealing the potential semantic relationship between patents, providing a reference for the inheritance and innovation evaluation of patents, and helping patent review before patent authorization and patent evaluation after patent authorization. [Method/ process] Firstly, the feature knowledge elements of patents are extracted based on rules and syntax analysis. Secondly, the Sentence-BERT and Word2Vec models are used to express the patent feature knowledge elements and the patent title abstract text quantitatively. Thirdly, the feature similarity and overall similarity of patents are calculated according to cosine similarity, and the semantic reference patent set of patents is obtained by combining the sequence of patent application dates. Finally, experimental research was carried out using patent data in the field of quantum computing. [Result/ conclusion] This method can realize the effective recognition of semantic reference patents, which is conducive to the evaluation of technical novelty, creativity, and practicability of patents, and provides support for patent review and patent value evaluation. © 2023 Information studies: Theory and Application.

Pretrained Quantum-Inspired Deep Neural Network for Natural Language Processing,"Natural language processing (NLP) may face the inexplicable 'black-box' problem of parameters and unreasonable modeling for lack of embedding of some characteristics of natural language, while the quantum-inspired models based on quantum theory may provide a potential solution. However, the essential prior knowledge and pretrained text features are often ignored at the early stage of the development of quantum-inspired models. To attacking the above challenges, a pretrained quantum-inspired deep neural network is proposed in this work, which is constructed based on quantum theory for carrying out strong performance and great interpretability in related NLP fields. Concretely, a quantum-inspired pretrained feature embedding (QPFE) method is first developed to model superposition states for words to embed more textual features. Then, a QPFE-ERNIE model is designed by merging the semantic features learned from the prevalent pretrained model ERNIE, which is verified with two NLP downstream tasks: 1) sentiment classification and 2) word sense disambiguation (WSD). In addition, schematic quantum circuit diagrams are provided, which has potential impetus for the future realization of quantum NLP with quantum device. Finally, the experiment results demonstrate QPFE-ERNIE is significantly better for sentiment classification than gated recurrent unit (GRU), BiLSTM, and TextCNN on five datasets in all metrics and achieves better results than ERNIE in accuracy, F1-score, and precision on two datasets (CR and SST), and it also has advantage for WSD over the classical models, including BERT (improves F1-score by 5.2 on average) and ERNIE (improves F1-score by 4.2 on average) and improves the F1-score by 8.7 on average compared with a previous quantum-inspired model QWSD.

PQLM - Multilingual Decentralized Portable Quantum Language Model,"With careful manipulation, malicious agents can reverse engineer private information encoded in pre-trained language models. Security concerns motivate the development of quantum pre-training. In this work, we propose a highly portable quantum language model (PQLM) that can easily transmit information to downstream tasks on classical machines. The framework consists of a cloud PQLM built with random Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC) and local models for downstream applications. We demonstrate the ad hoc portability of the quantum model by extracting only the word embeddings and effectively applying them to downstream tasks on classical machines. Our PQLM exhibits comparable performance to its classical counterpart on both intrinsic evaluation (loss, perplexity) and extrinsic evaluation (multilingual sentiment analysis accuracy) metrics. We also perform ablation studies on the factors affecting PQLM performance to analyze model stability.

Ensemble Learning Based Quantum Text Classifiers,"Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) is a very young area of research, aimed at the design and implementation of NLP models that exploit certain quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and interference to perform language-related tasks on quantum hardware. To explore the structural relationships between quantum theory and natural languages Lambeq toolkit was created. This first high-level open-source Python toolkit for quantum natural language processing offers a fully automated quantum machine learning pipeline. Lambeq currently includes five compositional models that use varying degrees of syntactic information. While the previous studies focus on Discocat model, the aim of this study is to conducte an extensive evaluation of various classifiers based on different compositional models for text classification applications, focusing on the potential advantages of ensemble learning. The classifiers, including Spider, Cups, Stairs, Tree, and DisCoCat, were examined on two datasets: MC and RP. Performance evaluation was carried out using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as the metrics. The results revealed notable variations in the performance of the classifiers across the datasets. Spider emerged as the top-performing classifier on the MC dataset, achieving remarkable scores of 100% in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. However, on the RP dataset, Stairs outperformed the other classifiers with an accuracy of 68%, precision of 71%, recall of 68%, and F1-score of 69%. Furthermore, ensemble models using hard voting and soft voting techniques were constructed and evaluated. The ensemble models showcased improved performance compared to individual classifiers, with the soft voting ensemble achieving a score of 97% for all metrics on the MC dataset, and a precision of 72% and F1-score of 68% on the RP dataset.

Passively Q-switched mode-locked thulium-doped fiber laser using nonlinear polarization rotation technique,"A Q-switched mode-locked (QML) thulium-doped fiber laser based on nonlinear polarization rotation (NPR) and negative group velocity dispersion (GVD) is demonstrated. This regime consists in the generation of a mode-locked (ML) pulse train under a Q-switched (QS) envelope. In this regard, by properly adjusting the polarization controllers and increasing the pump power in a range from 1 to 3 W, QML regime is obtained. With a maximum pump power of 3 W, a QS pulse duration of 1.46 μs and a pulse energy of 5.96 μJ are obtained. The maximum frequencies reached are 26 kHz and 2.63 MHz, corresponding to the Q-switched and mode-locked pulses, respectively. This method for generating a QML at 2 μm has the advantages of being eye-safe and robust, providing an ideal dual-frequency comb (DFC) generation method with high potential for various applications. © 2023",Durán-Sánchez M.; Espinosa-De-La-Cruz E.A.; Pottiez O.; Ibarra-Garrido A.; Alaniz-Baylón J.; Bello-Jiménez M.; Rodríguez-Morales L.A.; Armas-Rivera I.; Ibarra-Escamilla B.,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.02.056,2023,Article,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,
A Quantum Multimodal Neural Network Model for Sentiment Analysis on Quantum Circuits,"This paper proposes a quantum multimodal neural network (QMNN) model that can be implemented on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), providing a novel avenue for processing multimodal data and performing advanced multimodal sentiment analysis tasks. The comprehensive QMNN model is structured into four fundamental blocks: multimodal data preprocessing, unimodal feature extraction, multimodal feature fusion, and optimization. Through these blocks, multimodal data are initially preprocessed and encoded into quantum states. Subsequently, visual and textual features are extracted from the quantum states and are then integrated in order to learn the interactions between different modalities. Finally, the model parameters are fine-tuned to optimize the sentiment analysis performance. Simulation results confirm that QMNN surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, using significantly lower input dimensions and substantially fewer parameters than classical models. Furthermore, the entanglement, integrity, robustness, and scalability of the model are analyzed in depth. Internally, the strong entanglement within the multimodal fusion block enhances interactions between textual and visual features, and the integrity of the model reflects the indispensable contribution of each component to the overall performance. Externally, robustness ensures the model operates stably under noisy conditions and incomplete inputs, and scalability enables it to efficiently adapt to varying architectural depths and widths. The above simulation results and performance analyses showcase the comprehensive strength of our proposed model.  © 2020 IEEE.",Zheng J.; Gao Q.; Dong D.; Lu J.; Deng Y.,10.1109/TAI.2024.3511514,2024,Article,Scopus,Aceito,,,"O artigo propõe um modelo de rede neural quântica multimodal (QMNN), que pode ser implementado em circuitos quânticos parametrizados (PQCs) para processar dados multimodais e realizar análises avançadas de sentimento.

Quantum Feature Embeddings for Graph Neural Networks,"Quantum computing offers a promising avenue to reduce growing machine learning model complexity as required in large language models and simulation models for weather forecasts, financial forecasts, or engineering. Graph neural networks are a particular class of machine learning models that have garnered much attention for their ability to deal well with structured data. We investigate how to enhance existing GNNs and find through the inductive bias that quantum circuits are used best to encode node features. The proposed Quantum Feature Embeddings (QFEs) turn raw input features into quantum states, enabling non-linear and entangled representations. In particular, QFEs provide normalized, non-redundant weight matrices in an exponentially larger feature space and require much fewer qubits than fully quantum graph neural networks. On standard graph benchmark datasets, we showcase that for the same parameter count QFEs perform better than their classical counterpart, and are able to match the performance of an exponentially larger model. Finally, we study the potential benefit of using a hybrid quantum graph neural network over a classic alternative on a concrete use case, laser cutting. We find that the proposed model has the performance and thus the near-term potential to uplift these business applications. © 2024 IEEE Computer Society.

A Quantum Computing based Approach for Sentiment Analysis in Bilateral Conversations,"Sentiment analysis finds widespread applications in health, marketing, finance, stock markets, media, and politics. To analyze attitudes and emotions in textual data, handling large datasets and significant computational power is essential. Traditional computing methods struggle with the growing data volume, prompting interest in quantum computing as a promising alternative with its inherent high-speed processing capacity. This study focuses on sentiment analysis applied to texts derived from bilateral conversation dialogues. The primary objective is to categorize emotions within the text as positive, neutral, or negative, while concurrently identifying the speaker. To achieve this, a novel quantum-classical hybrid approach is proposed. The quantum side of this approach includes the variational quantum circuit (VQC). On the classical side, preprocessing of the data set, feature extraction with a model containing LSTM, and optimizing the parameters of VQC are performed. The proposed approach was trained and tested using a data set containing bilateral conversations. As a result of the tests, the proposed approach achieved a higher accuracy rate compared to studies using the classical approach.

Quantum Natural Language Processing: A Comprehensive Survey,"By using the quantum mechanics phenomenon, quantum computers provide a new dimension of computational power that drastically accelerates solving complex and resource-intensive problems. One of the most evolving but, due to the computation power of standard computers, reasonably limited application domain is natural language processing (NLP). NLP seeks to give interactive systems the ability to understand and manipulate human language. Making systems understand and manipulate human languages requires large amounts of data and computational power during learning as well as during the execution of NLP. For handling these amounts of data like text and audio recordings and the complexity of classical NLP algorithms, quantum computation has emerged as a promising solution.

Quantum machine learning for natural language processing application,"Quantum computing is a speedily emerging area that applies quantum mechanics properties to solve complex problems that are difficult for classical computing. Machine learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence which makes computers learn patterns from experiences. Due to the exponential growth of data, machine learning algorithms may be insufficient for big data, whereas on other side quantum computing can do fast computing. A combination of quantum computing and machine learning gave rise to a new field known as quantum machine learning. Quantum machine learning algorithms take advantage of the fast processing of quantum computing and show speedup compared to their classical counterpart. Natural language processing is another area of artificial intelligence that enables the computer to understand human languages. Now, researchers are trying to take advantage of quantum machine learning speedup in natural language processing applications.

Fuzz4ALL: Universal Fuzzing with Large Language Models,"Fuzzing has achieved tremendous success in discovering bugs and vulnerabilities in various software systems. Systems under test (SUTs) that take in programming or formal language as inputs, e.g., compilers, runtime engines, constraint solvers, and software libraries with accessible APIs, are especially important as they are fundamental building blocks of software development. However, existing fuzzers for such systems often target a specific language, and thus cannot be easily applied to other languages or even other versions of the same language. Moreover, the inputs generated by existing fuzzers are often limited to specific features of the input language, and thus can hardly reveal bugs related to other or new features. This paper presents Fuzz4ALL, the first fuzzer that is universal in the sense that it can target many different input languages and many different features of these languages. The key idea behind Fuzz4ALL is to leverage large language models (LLMs) as an input generation and mutation engine, which enables the approach to produce diverse and realistic inputs for any practically relevant language. To realize this potential, we present a novel autoprompting technique, which creates LLM prompts that are well- suited for fuzzing, and a novel LLM-powered fuzzing loop, which iteratively updates the prompt to create new fuzzing inputs. We evaluate Fuzz4ALL on nine systems under test that take in six different languages (C, C++, Go, SMT2, Java, and Python) as inputs. The evaluation shows, across all six languages, that universal fuzzing achieves higher coverage than existing, language-specific fuzzers. Furthermore, Fuzz4ALL has identified 98 bugs in widely used systems, such as GCC, Clang, Z3, CVC5, OpenJDK, and the Qiskit quantum computing platform, with 64 bugs already confirmed by developers as previously unknown.  © 2024 ACM.",Xia C.S.; Paltenghi M.; Tian J.L.; Pradel M.; Zhang L.,10.1145/3597503.3639121,2024,Conference paper,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,

Research on Distributional Compositional Categorical Model in Both Classical and Quantum Natural Language Processing,"Language models based on neural network primarily focus on learning patterns and representations from the input data, without explicitly modeling the grammatical structure of the text, thus often lacks of the consideration of syntax information.

"A Multimodal Machine Learning Approach to Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Treatment Prediction for Neurodegenerative Diseases and Cancer","Despite early diagnosis and estimating the future course of neurodegenerative and cancerous diseases being integral for survival of patients, clinical and algorithmic methods fail to effectively utilize the multimodal data available, are time-inefficient, and expensive, making it difficult to access accurate screenings for these diseases. Therefore, a novel end-to-end quantum machine learning approach using multiple data modalities for the identification of diagnoses, prognoses, and effective treatments is proposed. In a procedural flow, data is sourced from one or more of the following: CT scan images, webcam, patient-physician audio, Whole Slide Images, and clinical data. For image data, a Convolutional Neural Network, is employed to detect high level features. With text-based clinical data (including audio-derived data), a Bidirectional Encoder Representation model is used to extract text embeddings. For video data, pupil progression and average fixation duration features are manually crafted. All feature vectors are concatenated, normalized, passed through a Deep Neural Network, and then mapped to one of 38 neurodegenerative and cancerous diseases. For prognosis, features are pooled, concatenated with the diagnosis feature vector, and passed through another neural network with an output of survival times. Treatment prediction involves an information-retrieval task matching feature vectors to treatments/drug lists from the FDA. The proposed approach was tested on 5,000 patient profiles sourced from the public TCGA and JPND databases, outperforming all other state-of-the-art approaches. The model predicted diagnoses with an accuracy of 98.53%, achieved a Concordance Index of 0.94 in predicting prognoses, and in treatment prediction achieved a 99.32% accuracy. © 2022 IEEE.",Agarwal S.,10.1109/UEMCON54665.2022.9965655,2022,Conference paper,Scopus,Aceito,,Verificar,"Este artigo propõe uma abordagem quântica de aprendizado de máquina de ponta a ponta (end-to-end QML) para diagnóstico, prognóstico e sugestão de tratamentos de doenças neurodegenerativas e câncer, utilizando dados multimodais.",,,

Inspired by quantum entanglement coefficients, we construct two different entanglement coefficients to weight the different semantic contributions of words with different relations. Finally, the proposed model is applied to SICK_train to verify their performances. The experimental results show that the provided methods achieve perfect results.  © 2021 IEEE.",Yu Y.; Qiu D.; Yan R.,10.1109/ICKG52313.2021.00030,2021,Conference paper,Scopus,Aceito,,,"Este trabalho propõe um novo modelo de representação de sentenças em PLN, inspirado no conceito de emaranhamento quântico (quantum entanglement), com o objetivo de capturar tanto informações semânticas quanto estruturas sintáticas de forma eficiente e sem necessidade de conhecimento prévio (além do Word2Vec).",,,

A new method of software vulnerability detection based on a quantum neural network,"In the field of network security, although there has been related work on software vulnerability detection based on classic machine learning, detection ability is directly proportional to the scale of training data. A quantum neural network has been proven to solve the memory bottleneck problem of classical machine learning, so it has far-reaching prospects in the field of vulnerability detection. To fill the gap in this field, we propose a quantum neural network structure named QDENN for software vulnerability detection. This work is the first attempt to implement word embedding of vulnerability codes based on a quantum neural network, which proves the feasibility of a quantum neural network in the field of vulnerability detection. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed QDENN can effectively solve the inconsistent input length problem of quantum neural networks and the problem of batch processing with long sentences. Furthermore, it can give full play to the advantages of quantum computing and realize a vulnerability detection model at the cost of a small amount of measurement. Compared to other quantum neural networks, our proposed QDENN can achieve higher vulnerability detection accuracy. On the sub dataset with a small-scale interval, the model accuracy rate reaches 99%. On each subinterval data, the best average vulnerability detection accuracy of the model reaches 86.3%. © 2022, The Author(s).",Zhou X.; Pang J.; Yue F.; Liu F.; Guo J.; Liu W.; Song Z.; Shu G.; Xia B.; Shan Z.,10.1038/s41598-022-11227-3,2022,Article,Scopus,Aceito,,,"O artigo propõe um modelo de detecção de vulnerabilidades em software utilizando redes neurais quânticas (QNNs).

A deep dive into disruptive technologies in the oil and gas industry,"We have conducted research with 50 E&P companies to identify the emerging technologies that would have the potential to disrupt oil and gas industry in the next three to five years. Examples of these technologies include: Aerial Data Gathering & Interpretations, Artificial Intelligence including Machine & Deep Learning, Biosciences including DNA Sequencing CRISPR Editing, Blockchain, Micro fluidics, Digital Twin 2.0., Nanotechnology, Natural Language Processing, Quantum Computing, and 3D Printing. The scope of this research will include identification of those disrupting technologies, field level tactical applications of those technologies and use cases, the potential impact of those technologies voted by the 50 operators, and required conditions for top selected technologies to flourish. In this paper we will not review an individual technology to utmost technical depth but we will provide a portfolio view of emerging technologies and their level of impact on the industry. The foresight into the future technological disruptions is critical for the E&P companies who are investing millions of dollars each year in upgrading their equipment and infrastructure. Without this foresight, much of their investments could rapidly become obsolete. Our approach involved deep interviews with subject matter experts within 50 oil companies to collect a database of interests and needs by them. Then we investigated more than 150 technology innovators and startups to identify disruptive solutions that could match those particular needs of the operators. Finally, we brought the top selected technologies in touch with the operators in a one full day workshop to high-grade and discuss the implications. We have reviewed 20 technology trends that have the potential to be disruptive and found out that 5 of these technology trends attracted and were viewed as top areas for disruption by 80% of the operators. We also found out that a few of these technology themes are more fundamental and the enablers for the broader set of disruptions to happen, while a number of them are more secondary or consequential. Up to this date all research on frontier technologies that could have an impact on oil and gas industry have been studied academically and/or by industry on a one by one basis. This paper for the first time collects a statistically valid interpretation on the importance of these technologies by the resource holders themselves and takes a portfolio view on emerging technologies versus the silo view that makes it difficult to prioritize resources and technology roadmaps. This will benefit all stakeholders of the oil and gas industry ranging from operators, innovators, investors, and to the resource holder nations in large. © Copyright 2019, Offshore Technology Conference",Wishnow D.; Azar H.R.; Rad M.P.,,2020,Conference paper,Scopus,Rejeitado,Doi Indisponível,,,,,
Using Deep Learning to Understand and Mitigate the Qubit Noise Environment,"Understanding the spectrum of noise acting on a qubit can yield valuable information about its environment, and crucially underpins the optimization of dynamical decoupling protocols that can mitigate such noise. However, extracting accurate noise spectra from typical time-dynamics measurements on qubits is intractable using standard methods. Here, we propose to address this challenge using deep-learning algorithms, leveraging the remarkable progress made in the field of image recognition, natural language processing, and more recently, structured data. We demonstrate a neural-network-based methodology that allows for extraction of the noise spectrum associated with any qubit surrounded by an arbitrary bath, with significantly greater accuracy than the current methods of choice. The technique requires only a two-pulse echo decay curve as input data and can further be extended either for constructing customized optimal dynamical decoupling protocols or for obtaining critical qubit attributes such as its proximity to the sample surface. Our results can be applied to a wide range of qubit platforms, and provide a framework for improving qubit performance with applications not only in quantum computing and nanoscale sensing but also in material characterization techniques such as magnetic resonance. © 2021 authors.

Experiments on Fraud Detection use case with QML and TDA Mapper,"In the era of online financial transactions, it is significant for the credit card firms to be equipped with capabilities to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. This work covers study and implementation of two approaches for developing a credit card fraud detection model. First one, with hybrid quantum neural networks. In recent times, Quantum Computers (QC) are making their footprints into AI/ML domain. Quantum neural networks (QNN) hybrid with classical neural net has been used in various tasks such as - natural language processing, image processing etc. The second approach is with Topological Data Analysis (TDA). Finding topological structure in the input data also become relevant from the perspective of noise reduction. The visualization capabilities of TDA can become an aid in classification of credit card fraud as well. TDA is implemented with mapper based method here. In hybrid QNN, we are covering a reference implementation of Xanadu's StrawberryFields, where a classical network processes the input to be fed into a QNN model. Although technique wise these two approaches are drastically different, for the sake of generalization we implement TDA and hybrid QNN with a publicly available credit card fraud detection dataset. We tested with balanced fraud and genuine features and hybrid QNN model provides accuracy of 89.5%, whereas TDA mapper with our novel approach of classification provides an accuracy of 94%. © 2021 IEEE.",Mitra S.; Rao Jv K.,10.1109/QCE52317.2021.00083,2021,Conference paper,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,

Quantum natural language processing on near-term quantum computers,"In this work, we describe a full-stack pipeline for natural language processing on near-term quantum computers, aka QNLP. The language-modelling framework we employ is that of compositional distributional semantics (DisCoCat), which extends and complements the compositional structure of pregroup grammars. Within this model, the grammatical reduction of a sentence is interpreted as a diagram, encoding a specific interaction of words according to the grammar. It is this interaction which, together with a specific choice of word embedding, realises the meaning (or”semantics”) of a sentence. Building on the formal quantum-like nature of such interactions, we present a method for mapping DisCoCat diagrams to quantum circuits. Our methodology is compatible both with NISQ devices and with established Quantum Machine Learning techniques, paving the way to near-term applications of quantum technology to natural language processing. © K.

Classification of short texts using a wave model,"Quantum computing algorithms are actively developed and applied in the field of natural language processing. The authors of the paper proposed a new quantum-like method for classifying short texts. The basis of the method is the representation of the text as an ensemble of elementary particles. The value of the detection probability amplitude of a given ensemble at the selected points in space is chosen as a classification criterion. In this case, the space is understood as a vector space described using the distributive-semantic model of the language. The authors suggested one of the possible ways of interpreting the parameters of the wave function that describes the behavior of an elementary particle, as well as an algorithm for calculating the probability amplitude taking into account these parameters. For the experimental research of the described method, authors performed the classification of Internet communities by topics. For the analysis, the names and the “information” section of communities were used. In total, 100 groups of the social network “VKontakte” belonging to five various topics were taken. The proposed model showed rather high classification accuracy (91 % in general on the data set and from 75 % to 95 % within individual classes). The proposed model is supposed to be used to classify user comments about goods, services and events, as well as to determine some properties of the psychological portraits of users of online communities. © 2022, ITMO University.

A Model of Anaphoric Ambiguities using Sheaf Theoretic Quantum-like Contextuality and BERT,"Ambiguities of natural language do not preclude us from using it and context helps in getting ideas across. They, nonetheless, pose a key challenge to the development of competent machines to understand natural language and use it as humans do. Contextuality is an unparalleled phenomenon in quantum mechanics, where different mathematical formalisms have been put forwards to understand and reason about it. In this paper, we construct a schema for anaphoric ambiguities that exhibits quantum-like contextuality. We use a recently developed criterion of sheaf-theoretic contextuality that is applicable to signalling models. We then take advantage of the neural word embedding engine BERT to instantiate the schema to natural language examples and extract probability distributions for the instances. As a result, plenty of sheaf-contextual examples were discovered in the natural language corpora BERT utilises. Our hope is that these examples will pave the way for future research and for finding ways to extend applications of quantum computing to natural language processing. © K. I. Lo, M. Sadrzadeh & S.

Exploring Non-Linear Programming Formulations in QuantumCircuitOpt for Optimal Circuit Design,"Given the limitations of current hardware, the theoretical gains promised by quantum computing remain unre-alized across practical applications. But the gap between theory and hardware is closing, assisted by developments in quantum algorithmic modeling. One such recent development is Quan-tumCircuitOpt (QCOpt), an open-source software framework that leverages state-of-the-art optimization-based solvers to find provably optimal compact circuit decompositions, which are exact up to global phase and machine precision. The quantum circuit design problem can be modeled using non-linear, non-convex constraints. However, QCOpt reformulates these non-linear constraints using well-known linearization techniques such that the resulting design problem is solved as a mixed-integer linear programming model. In this work, we instead explore whether the QCOpt's model could also be effective with a continuous Non-Linear Programming (NLP) model obtained via relaxation of the integer variables in the non-linear constraints. We are able to present not only multiple significant enhancements to QCOpt, with up to 11.3x speed up in run times on an average, but also opportunities for more generally exploring the behavior of gradient-based NLP solvers. © 2022 IEEE.",Henderson E.R.; Nagarajan H.; Coffrin C.,10.1109/QCS56647.2022.00009,2022,Conference paper,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,

Quantum Machine Learning Applications in the Biomedical Domain: A Systematic Review,"Quantum technologies have become powerful tools for a wide range of application disciplines, which tend to range from chemistry to agriculture, natural language processing, and healthcare due to exponentially growing computational power and advancement in machine learning algorithms.

New technologies to enhance computer generated interactive virtual humans,"Conversation-like exchanges of information between users and computer-generated virtual humans can be computationally demanding. Many of the Grand Challenges facing the simulation community will further stress the concerned computer resources. These computer/human interfaces are currently being enhanced and will require both technical advances and societal changes. This paper offers a list of Virtual Human Grand Challenges, solicited from leaders in the community, for purposes of this discussion. Then the authors report on emerging technologies that will further enhance the “human” qualities of the previously mentioned interfaces. Some of these technologies are hardware based while others come from software developments. Further, system engineering advances are presented with the intention of making better use of all the aspects of the system to achieve simulation goals. On the hardware side, there is the emerging technology comprised of several threads of quantum computing, e.g. USC's 2,000 Qubit Quantum Annealer. Software advances of note are discussed in the areas of voice recognition, natural language processing, and deep learning. The use of quantum annealing to enhance deep learning is particularly examined. Systems engineering issues are analyzed, as these emerging technologies do not stand alone and must be integrated into or replace legacy systems, mandating close adherence to a range of standards. In each of these cases, the authors discuss theirs and others' experience with the technologies and explicate both the benefits and the costs of such implementations. The paper is written so as to assist the researcher and the systems implementers in choosing which of the new technologies warrants consideration for inclusion in their own work and which technologies will eventually require adoption in order to stay compatible with other systems. Other technologies may require more effort in implementation than they would provide utility in practice. © 2018 Fall Simulation Innovation Workshop: Leveraging the Power of Simulation, SIW 2018.

Quantum computations for disambiguation and question answering,"Automatic text processing is now a mature discipline in computer science, and so attempts at advancements using quantum computation have emerged as the new frontier, often under the term of quantum natural language processing. The main challenges consist in finding the most adequate ways of encoding words and their interactions on a quantum computer, considering hardware constraints, as well as building algorithms that take advantage of quantum architectures, so as to show improvement on the performance of natural language tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that starts from a grammar that can be interpreted by means of tensor contraction, to build word representations as quantum states that serve as input to a quantum algorithm. We start by introducing an operator measurement to contract the representations of words, resulting in the representation of larger fragments of text. We then go on to develop pipelines for the tasks of sentence meaning disambiguation and question answering that take advantage of quantum features. For the first task, we show that our contraction scheme deals with syntactically ambiguous phrases storing the various different meanings in quantum superposition, a solution not available on a classical setting. For the second task, we obtain a question representation that contains all possible answers in equal quantum superposition, and we implement Grover’s quantum search algorithm to find the correct answer, agnostic to the specific question, an implementation with the potential of delivering a result with quadratic speedup. © 2022, The Author(s).",Correia A.D.; Moortgat M.; Stoof H.T.C.,10.1007/s11128-022-03441-9,2022,Article,Scopus,Aceito,,,Este trabalho propõe um novo framework de Processamento de Linguagem Natural Quântico (QNLP) que usa representações de palavras como estados quânticos e aproveita propriedades da computação quântica como superposição e Grover’s search para realizar tarefas linguísticas como: Desambiguação de significados de sentenças e Resposta a perguntas (question answering),,,

A text classification algorithm based on quantum information,"Text classification is one of key problems in pattern recognition. The KNN algorithm is a widely used text classification algorithm, because it is simple, valid and non-parameters. The main idea of KNN algorithm is to calculate the similarity between the new sample with unknown class label and the training samples, and choosing the class label of the highest k nearest neighbors as the new sample's class label. However, the text contains hundreds and thousands of features. The similarity computing in large numbers of vector will cost many time. In fact that, many machine learning algorithms are unable to manipulate and compute large number of vectors in high-dimensional space. Quantum computing algorithms are good at computing high-dimensional vectors in large tensor product spaces. It can provide exponential speed-up over its classical counterparts.

Evaluating the Performance of Some Local Optimizers for Variational Quantum Classifiers,"In this paper, we have studied the performance and role of local optimizers in quantum variational circuits. We studied the performance of the two most popular optimizers and compared their results with some popular classical machine learning algorithms. The classical algorithms we used in our study are support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting (GB) and random forest (RF). These were compared with a variational quantum classifier (VQC) using two sets of local optimizers viz AQGD and COBYLA. For experimenting with VQC, IBM Quantum Experience and IBM Qiskit was used while for classical machine learning models, scikit-learn was used. The results show that machine learning on noisy immediate scale quantum machines can produce comparable results as on classical machines. For our experiments, we have used a popular restaurant sentiment analysis dataset. The extracted features from this dataset and then after applying PCA reduced the feature set into 5 features. Quantum ML models were trained using 100 epochs and 150 epochs on using EfficientSU2 variational circuit. Overall, four Quantum ML models were trained and three Classical ML models were trained. The performance of the trained models was evaluated using standard evaluation measures viz, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-Score. In all the cases AQGD optimizer-based model with 100 Epochs performed better than all other models. It produced an accuracy of 77% and an F-Score of 0.785 which were highest across all the trained models.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Joshi N.; Katyayan P.; Ahmed S.A.,10.1088/1742-6596/1817/1/012015,2021,Conference paper,Scopus,Aceito,,,Este artigo compara o desempenho de otimizadores locais em circuitos variacionais quânticos (VQC) com modelos clássicos de machine learning em uma tarefa de análise de sentimento com um dataset de restaurantes.,,,
Neural String Diagrams: A Universal Modelling Language for Categorical Deep Learning,"Category theory has been successfully applied to compositional modelling of diverse systems, including computational systems, logical systems, and physical systems, paving the way for a new kind of general system science (or rather general process science). It has been particularly successful in quantum computing and natural language processing recently; traditionally, it has played major rôles in compositional semantics of programming languages and symbolic reasoning systems. Building upon them, we propose the mathematical system of neural string diagrams as a universal modelling language for categorical deep learning, which allows us to turn informal neural network architecture pictures into formally explainable, mathematically verifiable, and systematically composable entities in their own right. We give, in particular, a neural string diagram account of CNN and Transformer (which has never been achieved before). Neural string diagrams can be computed with DisCoPy, Quantomatic, and their extensions. Categorically formalised neural networks can be instantiated for both ordinary vector spaces and other monoidal categorical structures, allowing for generalisations of deep learning (e.g., deep learning on relational structures, deep learning on graph and other network structures, etc.). We envisage that the category theory approach to artificial intelligence ultimately contributes to the development of artificial general intelligence, giving a universal modelling language for intelligent systems and agents. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Xu T.; Maruyama Y.,10.1007/978-3-030-93758-4_32,2022,Conference paper,Scopus,Aceito,,,"Este artigo apresenta ""neural string diagrams"", um sistema matemático baseado em teoria das categorias para modelar arquiteturas de deep learning (ex: CNNs e Transformers) de forma:",,,
Explainable natural language processing with matrix product states,"Despite empirical successes of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in natural language processing (NLP), theoretical understanding of RNNs is still limited due to intrinsically complex non-linear computations. We systematically analyze RNNs' behaviors in a ubiquitous NLP task, the sentiment analysis of movie reviews, via the mapping between a class of RNNs called recurrent arithmetic circuits (RACs) and a matrix product state. Using the von-Neumann entanglement entropy (EE) as a proxy for information propagation, we show that single-layer RACs possess a maximum information propagation capacity, reflected by the saturation of the EE. Enlarging the bond dimension beyond the EE saturation threshold does not increase model prediction accuracies, so a minimal model that best estimates the data statistics can be inferred. Although the saturated EE is smaller than the maximum EE allowed by the area law, our minimal model still achieves 1/499% training accuracies in realistic sentiment analysis data sets. Thus, low EE is not a warrant against the adoption of single-layer RACs for NLP. Contrary to a common belief that long-range information propagation is the main source of RNNs' successes, we show that single-layer RACs harness high expressiveness from the subtle interplay between the information propagation and the word vector embeddings. Our work sheds light on the phenomenology of learning in RACs, and more generally on the explainability of RNNs for NLP, using tools from many-body quantum physics.  © 2022 The Author(s).

A Quantum Natural Language Processing Approach to Musical Intelligence,"There has been tremendous progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for music, in particular for musical composition and access to large databases for commercialisation through the Internet. We are interested in further advancing this field, focusing on composition. In contrast to current ‘black-box’ AI methods, we are championing an interpretable compositional outlook on generative music systems. In particular, we are importing methods from the Distributional Compositional Categorical (DisCoCat) modelling framework for Natural Language Processing (NLP), motivated by musical grammars. Quantum computing is a nascent technology, which is very likely to impact the music industry in time to come. Thus, we are championing a Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) approach to develop a new generation of intelligent musical systems. This work follows previous experimental implementations of DisCoCat linguistic models on quantum hardware. In this chapter, we present Quanthoven, the first proof-of-concept ever built, which (a) demonstrates that it is possible to program a quantum computer to learn to classify music that conveys different meanings and (b) illustrates how such a capability might be leveraged to develop a system to compose meaningful pieces of music. After a discussion about our current understanding of music as a communication medium and its relationship to natural language, the chapter focuses on the techniques developed to (a) encode musical compositions as quantum circuits, and (b) design a quantum classifier. The chapter ends with demonstrations of compositions created with the system. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",Miranda E.R.; Yeung R.; Pearson A.; Meichanetzidis K.; Coecke B.,10.1007/978-3-031-13909-3_13,2022,Book chapter,Scopus,Rejeitado,Tipo de arquivo incorreto,,,,,
QUANTUM LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY,"Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a kind of recurrent neural networks (RNN) for sequence and temporal dependency data modeling and its effectiveness has been extensively established. In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical model of LSTM, which we dub QLSTM. We demonstrate that the proposed model successfully learns several kinds of temporal data. In particular, we show that for certain testing cases, this quantum version of LSTM converges faster, or equivalently, reaches a better accuracy, than its classical counterpart. Due to the variational nature of our approach, the requirements on qubit counts and circuit depth are eased, and our work thus paves the way toward implementing machine learning algorithms for sequence modeling such as natural language processing, speech recognition on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. © 2022 IEEE",Chen S.Y.-C.; Yoo S.; Fang Y.-L.L.,10.1109/ICASSP43922.2022.9747369,2022,Conference paper,Scopus,Aceito,,,"Este trabalho propõe um modelo híbrido quântico-clássico de LSTM, chamado QLSTM, com o objetivo de modelar dados com dependência temporal, como os encontrados em tarefas de processamento de linguagem natural (PLN) e reconhecimento de fala.",,,

word2ket: SPACE-EFFICIENT WORD EMBEDDINGS INSPIRED BY QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT,"Deep learning natural language processing models often use vector word embeddings, such as word2vec or GloVe, to represent words. A discrete sequence of words can be much more easily integrated with downstream neural layers if it is represented as a sequence of continuous vectors. Also, semantic relationships between words, learned from a text corpus, can be encoded in the relative configurations of the embedding vectors. However, storing and accessing embedding vectors for all words in a dictionary requires large amount of space, and may strain systems with limited GPU memory. Here, we used approaches inspired by quantum computing to propose two related methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, for storing word embedding matrix during training and inference in a highly efficient way. Our approach achieves a hundred-fold or more reduction in the space required to store the embeddings with almost no relative drop in accuracy in practical natural language processing tasks. © 2020 8th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2020.

Emotion Quantification Using Variational Quantum State Fidelity Estimation,"Sentiment analysis has been instrumental in developing artificial intelligence when applied to various domains. However, most sentiments and emotions are temporal and often exist in a complex manner. Several emotions can be experienced at the same time. Instead of recognizing only categorical information about emotions, there is a need to understand and quantify the intensity of emotions. The proposed research intends to investigate a quantum-inspired approach for quantifying emotional intensities in runtime. The inspiration comes from manifesting human cognition and decision-making capabilities, which may adopt a brief explanation through quantum theory. Quantum state fidelity was used to characterize states and estimate emotion intensities rendered by subjects from the Amsterdam Dynamic Facial Expression Set (ADFES) dataset. The Quantum variational classifier technique was used to perform this experiment on the IBM Quantum Experience platform. The proposed method successfully quantifies the intensities of joy, sadness, contempt, anger, surprise, and fear emotions of labelled subjects from the ADFES dataset.  © 2013 IEEE.",Singh J.; Ali F.; Shah B.; Bhangu K.S.; Kwak D.,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3216890,2022,Article,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,

Category theory and foundations of life science: A structuralist perspective on cognition,"Category theory has recently been applied successfully beyond mathematics and its foundations, for example, in quantum physics, quantum computing, linguistics, and natural language processing in artificial intelligence. Category theory today is arguably foundations of science as well as foundations of mathematics. Yet applications of category theory to the life sciences are still limited, and there are seemingly no clearly successful paradigmatic cases of them. Here we address foundational aspects of category theory in and across the sciences, and potential structural interconnections between category theory and the life sciences, in particular cognitive science. More specifically, we first address the two aspects of category theory as foundations of science and as foundations of mathematics in particular, and then discuss what category theory could do for foundations of life science, in particular cognitive science. We propose, amongst other things, a categorical structuralist approach to the mind-body problem as an alternative to reductionist approaches, which is arguably of both scientific and metaphysical significance at the same time. Category theory allows us to elucidate structural interconnections between the laws of cognition and the laws of reality, thus paving the way for overcoming the Cartesian dualism separating the cognitive and physical worlds. Put another way, category theory suggests that there may be higher laws governing both worlds at once; the higher structuralist theory of cognition may embody the double aspect theory of information by David Chalmers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Maruyama Y.,10.1016/j.biosystems.2021.104376,2021,Article,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,
Optimizing a quantum reservoir computer for time series prediction,"Quantum computing and neural networks show great promise for the future of information processing. In this paper we study a quantum reservoir computer (QRC), a framework harnessing quantum dynamics and designed for fast and efficient solving of temporal machine learning tasks such as speech recognition, time series prediction and natural language processing. Specifically, we study memory capacity and accuracy of a quantum reservoir computer based on the fully connected transverse field Ising model by investigating different forms of inter-spin interactions and computing timescales. We show that variation in inter-spin interactions leads to a better memory capacity in general, by engineering the type of interactions the capacity can be greatly enhanced and there exists an optimal timescale at which the capacity is maximized. To connect computational capabilities to physical properties of the underlaying system, we also study the out-of-time-ordered correlator and find that its faster decay implies a more accurate memory.

"The Digital Text Workshop Cloud, New Solutions for Super Calculation Environments","Quantum physics is the basis of scientific thinking and influences the mind. Wendt [1] in Quantum Mind and Social Science argues that the mind and social life are macroscopic phenomena of quantum mechanics and that the quantum consciousness hypothesis is the cognitive basis of a quantum social science. In these new scientific parameters of knowledge, our visualization matrix is essentially a holographic projection. Research innovation lies in seeking the point of convergence to describe a formal process that, as a multi-code process, goes from a phase of joined sentences to a data implementation phase, Planat of the Institute of Femto -ST Dep. of Micro Nano Sciences and Systems, Besançon, France. The goal is to find points of contact between quantum physics, computational linguistics, and quantum computing. Planat [2] states that the quality that the linguist must possess beyond courage is… Competence to transcribe mathematical concepts into grammatical structures.

Efficient On-Chip Training of Optical Neural Networks Using Genetic Algorithm,"Recent advances in silicon photonic chips have made huge progress in optical computing owing to their flexibility in the reconfiguration of various tasks. Its deployment of neural networks serves as an alternative for mitigating the rapidly increased demand for computing resources in electronic platforms. However, it remains a formidable challenge to train the online programmable optical neural networks efficiently, being restricted by the difficulty in obtaining gradient information on a physical device when executing a gradient descent algorithm. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an efficient, physics-agnostic, and closed-loop protocol for training optical neural networks on chip. A gradient-free algorithm, that is, the genetic algorithm, is adopted. The protocol is on-chip implementable, physical agnostic (no need to rely on characterization and offline modeling), and gradient-free. The protocol works for various types of chip structures and is especially helpful to those that cannot be analytically decomposed and characterized. We confirm its viability using several practical tasks, including the crossbar switch and the Iris classification. Finally, by comparing our physics-agonistic and gradient-free method to the off-chip and gradient-based training methods, we demonstrate the robustness of our system to perturbations such as imperfect phase implementation and photodetection noise.

An empirical validation for predicting bugs and the release time of open source software using entropy measures—Software reliability growth models,"Envisaging software defects is one of the vital fields of exploration in software engineering. Researchers have formulated and executed a plethora of bug forecasting methodologies by computing the performance in terms of precision and difficulty. Various statistical models are established in the literature to observe bug existence and restoring method; these models are termed software reliability growth models. The existence of bugs in software is primarily because of the constant variations in the software code. Open source software is prevalent amongst academicians and has found users in big businesses. OSS is extremely effective, but source code variations have to be made regularly through the progressively advanced requirement at the user’s end. The open source group is expanding rapidly, and numerous categories of provisions are offered. Stakeholders contribute to OSS in business by reinforcing the value of schemes, taking into account great revenue earnings and novel scheme expansion. An essential feature of open source software is determining when to issue a novel form. The principal goal is to announce the software at a suitable time with minimal economic restrictions. The approach after announcing software is a challenge and announcement development performs a vital function in handling effective announcements to clients. It is essentially a group of novel characteristics that are combined to form an invention setting. The primary announcement is just after the expansion procedure and additional consequent announcements are founded upon the preceding announcements, number of prerequisites, and faults restored. Each announcement incorporates a collection of characteristics fulfilling particular restrictions of the corporation as required by the customers. Forming conclusions about what characteristics are to be encompassed in which announcement is a tiresome job. Information theory, which deals with computation and communication of knowledge around a network, was primarily invented by Claude E Shannon. It is a probabilistic established method that emphasizes the computation of vagueness associating data. It has widespread prospective functions in areas including model recognition, statistical interpretation, natural language processing, thermal physics, quantum computing, etc. Entropy is a significant subdivision of information theory that performs a principal function in examining the code change procedure. It is a quantity of uncertainty/difficulty of code change and portrays the quantity of information covered in an event. In this chapter, a method of captivating the number of faults documented in numerous announcements of Bugzilla software is established and distinctive amounts of entropy for the alterations in various software, which informs these intervals, are computed. Initially simple linear regression is employed to envisage faults that are expected to occur in the future. By means of anticipated faults and entropy measures in multiple linear regression, the announcement period of the software has been forecast. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Quantum Computing-Enabled Machine Learning for an Enhanced Model Training Approach,"Machine learning is an exciting area where ever-growing problems such as anomaly detection using sensor data, natural language processing, image processing, etc., are solved using complex yet fascinating algorithms. Such algorithms learn the function that maps input to output from the training examples. The algorithms are evaluated with the validation data and then used to predict the output for an unknown dataset. For the past few years, scholars have been researching to improve such classical machine learning algorithms using quantum computing. Some of the latest research is the optimization of computationally expensive algorithms with quantum computing and transforming stochastic procedures into the semantics of quantum theory. The quest for the learning-based algorithm is aspiring: the discipline seeks to comprehend what learning is and studies how algorithms approximate learning. Quantum machine learning takes these aspirations further by looking at the subatomic level to aid learning. Machine learning-based algorithms minimize a constrained multivariate function. Different algorithms have different hyper-parameters that need to be tuned for the trained model to generalize well. Such optimization has high time and space complexity, which is central to learning theory. This contribution gives an organized overview of the evolving arena of quantum machine learning. It presents the methods as well as practical details. We start this chapter by introducing the major components of Quantum Computers, where we provide an overview of quantum computing with an in-depth explanation of the superposition of state, which will be crucial for all quantum algorithms. Next, we exploit a fascinating phenomenon called entanglement in quantum computations. Parallelism is the key to speeding up the training process of learning algorithms. One of the significant advantages of quantum computing is quantum parallelism which we will explore through Grover's search algorithm. Next, we go over the learning mechanism of a traditional machine learning algorithm, namely a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on classical computers. Furthermore, we exploit the Quantum SVM (QSVM) trained on quantum computers. Finally, we solve the famous malignant breast cancer classification problem using the quantum SVM algorithm.

Machine Learning: Quantum vs Classical,"Encouraged by growing computing power and algorithmic development, machine learning technologies have become powerful tools for a wide variety of application areas, spanning from agriculture to chemistry and natural language processing. The use of quantum systems to process classical data using machine learning algorithms has given rise to an emerging research area, i.e. quantum machine learning. Despite its origins in the processing of classical data, quantum machine learning also explores the use of quantum phenomena for learning systems, the use of quantum computers for learning on quantum data and how machine learning algorithms and software can be formulated and implemented on quantum computers. Quantum machine learning can have a transformational effect on computer science. It may speed up the processing of information well beyond the existing classical speeds. Recent work has seen the development of quantum algorithms that could serve as foundations for machine learning applications. Despite its great promise, there are still significant hardware and software challenges that need to be resolved before quantum machine learning becomes practical. In this paper, we present an overview of quantum machine learning in the light of classical approaches. Departing from foundational concepts of machine learning and quantum computing, we discuss various technical contributions, strengths and similarities of the research work in this domain. We also elaborate upon the recent progress of different quantum machine learning approaches, their complexity, and applications in various fields such as physics, chemistry and natural language processing. © 2013 IEEE.",Khan T.M.; Robles-Kelly A.,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3041719,2020,Article,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,

Temporal information processing on noisy quantum computers,"The combination of machine learning and quantum computing has emerged as a promising approach for addressing previously untenable problems. Reservoir computing is an efficient learning paradigm that utilizes nonlinear dynamical systems for temporal information processing, i.e., processing of input sequences to produce output sequences. Here we propose quantum reservoir computing that harnesses complex dissipative quantum dynamics. Our class of quantum reservoirs is universal, in that any nonlinear fading memory map can be approximated arbitrarily closely and uniformly over all inputs by a quantum reservoir from this class. We describe a subclass of the universal class that is readily implementable using quantum gates native to current noisy gate-model quantum computers. Proof-of-principle experiments on remotely accessed cloud-based superconducting quantum computers demonstrate that small and noisy quantum reservoirs can tackle high-order nonlinear temporal tasks. Our theoretical and experimental results pave the path for attractive temporal processing applications of near-term gate-model quantum computers of increasing fidelity but without quantum error correction, signifying the potential of these devices for wider applications including neural modeling, speech recognition, and natural language processing, going beyond static classification and regression tasks. © 2020 American Physical Society.",Chen J.; Nurdin H.I.; Yamamoto N.,10.1103/PhysRevApplied.14.024065,2020,Article,Scopus,Aceito,,,"O artigo propõe um modelo de Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) baseado em dinâmicas quânticas dissipativas complexas para tarefas temporais — ou seja, processar sequências de entrada para produzir saídas (por exemplo, NLP, fala, etc.).",,,
Supervised Question Classification on SelQA Dataset Using Variational Quantum Classifiers,"Machine learning and quantum computing fuse together to form quantum machine learning. Although the phenomenon is new, it has already proved its worth in various fields like finance and chemistry. The potential of quantum computing and its extraordinary properties enable us to process data in a way classical computer can never think of. When machine learning gets the power of quantum computing, information processing is enhanced significantly. In this paper, we have used variational quantum classifiers to classify questions from two domains of SelQA dataset.

Quantum Natural Language Processing: Challenges and Opportunities,"The meeting between Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Quantum Computing has been very successful in recent years, leading to the development of several approaches of the so-called Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP). This is a hybrid field in which the potential of quantum mechanics is exploited and applied to critical aspects of language processing, involving different NLP tasks. Approaches developed so far span from those that demonstrate the quantum advantage only at the theoretical level to the ones implementing algorithms on quantum hardware. This paper aims to list the approaches developed so far, categorizing them by type, i.e., theoretical work and those implemented on classical or quantum hardware; by task, i.e., general purpose such as syntax-semantic representation or specific NLP tasks, like sentiment analysis or question answering; and by the resource used in the evaluation phase, i.e., whether a benchmark dataset or a custom one has been used. The advantages offered by QNLP are discussed, both in terms of performance and methodology, and some considerations about the possible usage QNLP approaches in the place of state-of-the-art deep learning-based ones are given. © 2022 by the authors.

Application of Quantum Natural Language Processing for Language Translation,"In this paper, we develop compositional vector-based semantics of positive transitive sentences using quantum natural language processing (Q-NLP) to compare the parametrized quantum circuits of two synonymous simple sentences in English and Persian. We propose a protocol based on quantum long short-term memory (Q-LSTM) for Q-NLP to perform various tasks in general but specifically for translating a sentence from English to Persian. Then, we generalize our method to use quantum circuits of sentences as an input for the Q-LSTM cell. This enables us to translate sentences in different languages. Our work paves the way toward representing quantum neural machine translation, which may demonstrate quadratic speedup and converge faster or reaches a better accuracy over classical methods.  © 2013 IEEE.",Abbaszade M.; Salari V.; Mousavi S.S.; Zomorodi M.; Zhou X.,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3108768,2021,Article,Scopus,Aceito,,,"O artigo desenvolve uma semântica vetorial composicional para sentenças transitivas positivas utilizando Quantum Natural Language Processing (Q-NLP), com foco na comparação entre sentenças simples em inglês e persa.",,,
Quantum algorithms for compositional natural language processing,"We propose a new application of quantum computing to the field of natural language processing. Ongoing work in this field attempts to incorporate grammatical structure into algorithms that compute meaning. In [5, 7], Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark introduce such a model (the CSC model) based on tensor product composition. While this algorithm has many advantages, its implementation is hampered by the large classical computational resources that it requires. In this work we show how computational shortcomings of the CSC approach could be resolved using quantum computation (possibly in addition to existing techniques for dimension reduction). We address the value of quantum RAM [8] for this model and extend an algorithm from Wiebe, Braun and Lloyd [24] into a quantum algorithm to categorize sentences in CSC. Our new algorithm demonstrates a quadratic speedup over classical methods under certain conditions. ï¿½ W. Zeng & B.

Quantum Mathematics in Artificial Intelligence,"In the decade since 2010, successes in artificial intelligence have been at the forefront of computer science and technology, and vector space models have solidified a position at the forefront of artificial intelligence. At the same time, quantum computers have become much more powerful, and announcements of major advances are frequently in the news. The mathematical techniques underlying both these areas have more in common than is sometimes realized. Vector spaces took a position at the axiomatic heart of quantum mechanics in the 1930s, and this adoption was a key motivation for the derivation of logic and probability from the linear geometry of vector spaces. Quantum interactions between particles are modelled using the tensor product, which is also used to express objects and operations in artificial neural networks. This paper describes some of these common mathematical areas, including examples of how they are used in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in automated reasoning and natural language processing (NLP). Techniques discussed include vector spaces, scalar products, subspaces and implication, orthogonal projection and negation, dual vectors, density matrices, positive operators, and tensor products. Application areas include information retrieval, categorization and implication, modelling word-senses and disambiguation, inference in knowledge bases, decision making, and semantic composition. Some of these approaches can potentially be implemented on quantum hardware. Many of the practical steps in this implementation are in early stages, and some are already realized. Explaining some of the common mathematical tools can help researchers in both AI and quantum computing further exploit these overlaps, recognizing and exploring new directions along the way. © 2021 AI Access Foundation.",Widdows D.; Kitto K.; Cohen T.,10.1613/JAIR.1.12702,2021,Article,Scopus,Aceito,,,"Explora as semelhanças matemáticas fundamentais entre a inteligência artificial (IA) — especialmente o processamento de linguagem natural (NLP) — e a computação quântica, com ênfase em vetores, tensores e produtos internos, que são centrais em ambos os campos.",,,
Quantum Artificial Intelligence Based Node Localization Technique for Wireless Networks,"Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have received significant attention among research communities in the field of networking, image processing, natural language processing, robotics, etc. At the same time, a major problem in wireless sensor networks (WSN) is node localization, which aims to identify the exact position of the sensor nodes (SN) using the known position of several anchor nodes. WSN comprises a massive number of SNs and records the position of the nodes, which becomes a tedious process. Besides, the SNs might be subjected to node mobility and the position alters with time. So, a precise node localization (NL) manner is required for determining the location of the SNs. In this view, this paper presents a new quantum bird migration optimizer-based NL (QBMA-NL) technique for WSN. The goal of the QBMA-NL approach is for determining the position of unknown nodes in the network by the use of anchor nodes. The QBMA-NL technique is mainly based on the mating behavior of bird species at the time of mating season. In addition, an objective function is derived based on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and Euclidean distance from the known to unknown SNs. For demonstrating the improved performance of the QBMA-NL technique, a wide range of simulations take place and the results reported the supreme performance over the recent NL techniques. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

The categorical integration of symbolic and statistical AI: Quantum NLP and applications to cognitive and machine bias problems,"Statistical AI is cutting-edge technology in the present landscape of AI research whilst Symbolic AI is generally regarded as good old-fashioned AI. Even so, we contend that induction, i.e., learning from empirical data, cannot constitute a full-fledged form of intelligence on its own, and it is necessary to combine it with deduction, i.e., reasoning on theoretical grounds, in order to achieve the ultimate goal of Strong AI or Artificial General Intelligence. We therefore think of the possibility of integrating Symbolic and Statistical AI, and discuss Quantum Linguistics by Bob Coecke et al., which, arguably, may be seen as the categorical integration of Symbolic and Statistical AI, and as a paradigmatic case of Integrated AI in Natural Language Processing. And we apply it to cognitive bias problems in the Kahneman-Tversky tradition, giving a novel account of them from the standpoints of Symbolic/Statistical/Integrated AI, and thus elucidating the nature of machine biases in them. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Maruyama Y.,10.1007/978-3-030-49342-4_45,2021,Conference paper,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,

QNLP in Practice: Running Compositional Models of Meaning on a Quantum Computer,"Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) deals with the design and implementation of NLP models intended to be run on quantum hardware. In this paper, we present results on the first NLP experiments conducted on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers for datasets of size greater than 100 sentences. Exploiting the formal similarity of the compositional model of meaning by Coecke, Sadrzadeh, and Clark (2010) with quantum theory, we create representations for sentences that have a natural mapping to quantum circuits. We use these representations to implement and successfully train NLP models that solve simple sentence classification tasks on quantum hardware. We conduct quantum simulations that compare the syntax-sensitive model of Coecke et al. with two baselines that use less or no syntax; specifically, we implement the quantum analogues of a “bag-of-words” model, where syntax is not taken into account at all, and of a word-sequence model, where only word order is respected. We demonstrate that all models converge smoothly both in simulations and when run on quantum hardware, and that the results are the expected ones based on the nature of the tasks and the datasets used. Another important goal of this paper is to describe in a way accessible to AI and NLP researchers the main principles, process and challenges of experiments on quantum hardware. Our aim in doing this is to take the first small steps in this unexplored research territory and pave the way for practical Quantum Natural Language Processing. ©2023 AI Access Foundation.

In this paper, we propose a quantum neural network, in which the quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is used to optimize parameters. To analysze the system performance, it has been applied to function fitting and data classification and it is shown by classical simulation and experimentation that the proposed model is more efficient and powerful than ANN for a lot of experimental tasks.

Realization of Long Short-Term Memory Networks on Quantum Circuits,"As one of the well-known methods to solve natural language processing (NLP) problems, the long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) has been designed to implement on quantum computers. However, existing method requires the number of qubits is equal to the dimension of the word vectors, and may result in a surge of the qubit number.

TorchQuantum case study for robust quantum circuits,"Quantum Computing has attracted much research attention because of its potential to achieve fundamental speed and efficiency improvements in various domains. Among different quantum algorithms, Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) for Quantum Machine Learning (QML) show promises to realize quantum advantages on the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) Machines. Therefore, to facilitate the QML and PQC research, a recent python library called TorchQuantum has been released. It can construct, simulate, and train PQC for machine learning tasks with high speed and convenient debugging supports. Besides quantum for ML, we want to raise the community s attention on the reversed direction: ML for quantum. Specifically, the TorchQuantum library also supports using data-driven ML models to solve problems in quantum system research, such as predicting the impact of quantum noise on circuit fidelity and improving the quantum circuit compilation efficiency. This paper presents a case study of the ML for quantum part in TorchQuantum. Since estimating the noise impact on circuit reliability is an essential step toward understanding and mitigating noise, we propose to leverage classical ML to predict noise impact on circuit fidelity. I nspired by the natural graph representation of quantum circuits, we propose to leverage a graph transformer model to predict the noisy circuit fidelity.We firstly collect a large dataset with a variety of quantum circuits and obtain their fidelity on noisy simulators and real machines. Then we embed each circuit into a graph with gate and noise properties as node features, and adopt a graph transformer to predict the fidelity.We can avoid exponential classical simulation cost and efficiently estimate fidelity with polynomial complexity. Evaluated on 5 thousand random and algorithm circuits, the graph transformer predictor can provide accurate fidelity estimation with RMSE error 0.04 and outperform a simple neural networkbased model by 0.02 on average. It can achieve 0.99 and 0.95 R2 scores for random and algorithm circuits, respectively. Compared with circuit simulators, the predictor has over 200× speedup for estimating the fidelity. The datasets and predictors can be accessed in the TorchQuantum library.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Wang H.; Liang Z.; Gu J.; Li Z.; Ding Y.; Jiang W.; Shi Y.; Pan D.Z.; Chong F.T.; Han S.,10.1145/3508352.3561118,2022,Conference paper,Scopus,Rejeitado,Não está alinhado com o tema,,,,,

The effects of phonological recoding on taiwanese students’ reading processes: Evidence from eye tracking experiments,"Phonological recoding is a psychological process in which readers convert printed words into sounds (i.e., phonological codes) during silent reading. The role of phonological recoding in reading has long been debated in the field of psycholinguistics. Most relevant studies have mainly focused on examining the role of phonological recoding in word recognition. Three major theoretical approaches have been proposed for lexical access. First, the phonological mediation model assumes that the meaning of a word is accessed through its phonology; that is, the sequence of the word recognition process is orthography phonology semantics. Phonological recoding of a word occurs prior to the access of its meaning (Lukatela & Turvey, 1994; Rayner, Pollatsek, & Binder, 1998; Van Orden, Johnston, & Hale, 1988). Second, the direct access route model assumes that the meaning of a word can be directly accessed through the transition from orthography to semantics without the mediation of phonology (M. Coltheart & Coltheart, 1997; Taft & Van Graan, 1998). The model, however, does not deny the possibility of phonological activation. Rather, it assumes that phonological recoding occurs concurrently to or later than the access of the word’s meaning. Third, the dual route model suggests that two parallel running routes can achieve lexical access: one is the phonologically mediated route, and the other is the direct access route (M. Coltheart, 2000). The route that achieves lexical access depends on the route that runs the fastest (Barron, 1986; Paap, Noel, & Johansen, 1992). McCusker, Hillinger, and Bias (1981) indicated that the difficulty of material, subjects’ reading fluency, the frequency of occurrence of items, and task demands can determine the use of phonological recoding. Chinese is a logographic language and is also regarded as a phonologically opaque one. Nevertheless, studies investigating the time course of phonological activation in Chinese word recognition have yielded inconsistent results. Although some evidence has suggested that phonology can be activated very early in the word recognition process when Chinese readers read Chinese words or sentences (Guo, Peng, & Liu, 2005; Tan, Hoosain, & Peng, 1995; Zhang & Perfetti, 1993), it remains controversial whether phonological recoding plays a crucial role in word recognition and text comprehension. Few studies have measured Chinese subjects’ reading comprehension under the condition of articulatory suppression, which has been proven to interfere with phonological recoding (Lu & Zhang, 2007; Ding & Wang, 2006). However, the results of such studies have been inconsistent, and whether phonological recoding is important for Chinese text comprehension remains unclear. This study conducted two eye-tracking experiments by using the same experimental paradigm implemented by Guan (2015, 2020) to investigate whether adult Chinese readers need to rely on phonological recoding to understand short expository texts and also whether readers without the background knowledge relevant to domain-specific texts must rely more on phonological recoding to comprehend them. In Experiment 1, 30 university students in Taipei were recruited whose mother tongue was Mandarin Chinese. They were asked to read 20 short expository texts (each one was 350 characters in length) under five different reading conditions: articulatory suppression, reading aloud, concurrent reading and listening to an irrelevant text (IRS), reading while listening to the same text (RWL), and silent reading. The topics of the texts included, for example, “advice for new graduates when entering workforce,” “the impact of 3C products on human cognition,” “water pollution,” “the color of eggs,” “the crisis of water resources,” “the function of sun light,” “the philosopher and the frog,” “Mr. thought,” “experiment with monkeys,” “the stereotypes of teachers in Taiwan,” and “the influences of watching TV on small children.” Subjects’ reading time and comprehension score for each text as well as their eye movements were recorded, which were then analyzed by several linear or generalized linear mixed models to find the best fitting model for each dependent variable. The results revealed that articulatory suppression significantly impaired reading comprehension and caused a larger regression ratio in text reading as well as a higher rereading rate on target words, whereas the effects of the other reading conditions on comprehension did not differ from each other. These results suggest that phonological recoding is essential for Chinese expository text comprehension and word recognition. Reading aloud, compared with silent reading, significantly increased the overall reading time, mean fixation duration, and number of fixations in a text but substantially reduced the mean saccade length and regression ratio. In word-level processing, reading aloud led to a much longer first fixation duration, gaze duration, rereading time, and total reading time on target words selected in the texts. Through word-by-word reading, reading aloud seemed to facilitate integrated sentence meaning, but it failed to significantly enhance overall reading comprehension. Moreover, RWL caused higher rereading rates on target words than did silent reading, and it did not improve reading comprehension. In line with results found under the reading aloud condition, the null effects of reading aloud and RWL on reading comprehension could indicate that both reading conditions make the covert phonological recoding during silent reading overt and therefore imposed similar effects on reading comprehension to those exerted by the phonological recoding in silent reading. Experiment 2 was conducted to further examine whether subjects’ background knowledge regarding the text content would moderate their reliance on phonological recoding in understanding domain-specific texts, such that subjects without much background knowledge would rely more on phonological recoding in the processing of unfamiliar terms and text content. To this end, 15 excerpts from journal articles in Scientific American were used as experimental materials. The topics of these texts were all about physics, such as the Higgs boson, quantum computing, loop quantum gravity, antimatter, charge-coupled devices, and 3He superfluid. The same experimental paradigm as in Experiment 1 was used in Experiment 2, and a different sample of 30 university students in Taipei were recruited as participants. Half majored in humanities and social sciences and had no background knowledge in physics. The other half of the students majored in natural sciences, such as physics, atmospheric physics, and materials science; therefore, they had background knowledge in physics. Participants were asked to read the texts and answer four comprehension questions after reading each text. The results revealed that only background knowledge had a significant effect on reading comprehension, whereas reading conditions and their interaction with background knowledge did not exhibit any significant effects. Participants with relevant background knowledge performed significantly better than did their counterparts. However, background knowledge did not moderate participants’ dependency on phonological recoding in reading comprehension. It seems that phonological recoding did not play a crucial role in understanding short domain-specific texts. Analysis of participants’ eye movements indicated that reading aloud could slow their reading speed and reduce their regression ratio, but it did not enhance reading comprehension. RWL increased the rereading rate on target words in short expository texts, and it increased reading time and the mean fixation duration in domain specific texts. IRS did not affect comprehension performance; it only increased the rereading rate on domain-specific target words and prolonged the first fixation duration for participants without relevant background knowledge. In sum, the results of this study suggest that phonological recoding provides critical support for Chinese adult readers to comprehend short expository texts, but it only plays a minor role in understanding domain-specific texts. When participants read domain-specific texts, it was their background knowledge that dominated their reading comprehension performance. © 2020, National Taiwan Normal University.

Implications of Deep Circuits in Improving Quality of Quantum Question Answering,"Question Answering (QA) has proved to be an arduous challenge in the area of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). Many attempts have been made to develop complete solutions for QA as well as improving significant sub-modules of the QA systems to improve the overall performance through the course of time. Questions are the most important piece of QA, because knowing the question is equivalent to knowing what counts as an answer (Harrah in Philos Sci 28:40–46, 1961, [1]). In this work, we have attempted to understand questions in a better way by using Quantum Machine Learning (QML). The properties of Quantum Computing (QC) have enabled classically intractable data processing. So, in this paper, we have performed question classification on questions from two classes of SelQA (Selection-based Question Answering) dataset using quantum-based classifier algorithms—quantum support vector machine (QSVM) and variational quantum classifier (VQC) from Qiskit (Quantum Information Science toolKIT) for Python. We perform classification with both classifiers in almost similar environments and study the effects of circuit depths while comparing the results of both classifiers. We also use these classification results with our own rule-based QA system and observe significant performance improvement. Hence, this experiment has helped in improving the quality of QA in general. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Katyayan P.; Joshi N.,10.1007/978-981-19-9530-9_23,2023,Book chapter,Scopus,Rejeitado,Tipo de arquivo incorreto,,,,,
Quantum Representation for Sentiment Classification,"While the application of quantum computing to natural language processing (NLP) has seen substantial work in recent years, not much has been presented on sentiment analysis to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. This preliminary study investigates how sentiment can be represented correctly and efficiently for quantum natural language processing (QNLP). In particular, we present four possible approaches for representing sentiment words in the quantum case. We propose to utilize two quantum operations (i.e., X gate and Z-X gate), each with two different placements, to represent a negative sentence in a quantum circuit. Subsequently, we train the corresponding state vector using several classical classifiers: SVM, SPSA, and a combination of both, then evaluate the result in terms of accuracy. Experimental results show that the third approach, i.e., adding an X-gate at the end of the sentence outperforms other settings. Additionally, the third approach, along with the combined classifier of SVM and SPSA, reaches up to 81.67% accuracy. The proposed method can be helpful for applications of sentiment analysis in quantum computers.  © 2022 IEEE.",Ruskanda F.Z.; Rifat Abiwardani M.; Al Bari M.A.; Arya Bagaspati K.; Mulyawan R.; Syafalni I.; Larasati H.T.,10.1109/QCE53715.2022.00025,2022,Conference paper,Scopus,Aceito,,,Aplicação de computação quântica à análise de sentimentos,,,

Quantum Natural Language Generation on Near-Term Devices,"The emergence of noisy medium-scale quantum devices has led to proof-of-concept applications for quantum computing in various domains. Examples include Natural Language Processing (NLP) where sentence classification experiments have been carried out, as well as procedural generation, where tasks such as geopolitical map creation, and image manipulation have been performed. We explore applications at the intersection of these two areas by designing a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for sentence generation. Our algorithm is based on the well-known simulated annealing technique for combinatorial optimisation. An implementation is provided and used to demonstrate successful sentence generation on both simulated and real quantum hardware. A variant of our algorithm can also used for music generation.

Sentence Classification Using Quantum Natural Language Processing and Comparison of Optimization Methods,"The natural language processing (NLP) demands high computing resourses to process language related problems. The evolution of quantum computing hardware and simulators create avenues to design and develop NLP methods to test on these platforms. This research uses quantum natural language processing (QNLP) to simulate the sentence classification and compares optimization techniques (Simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation: SPSA and convergent optimization via most-promising-area stochastic search: COMPASS) for small dataset and simple sentence structures and the results are promising to show that with the COMPASS optimization technique the model performs better Table 1. When the ansatz depth is less and vice-versa. The research in quantum natural language processing is infancy, the simulation results are promising and the better results can be expected for large datasets with different sentence structures if real quantum computers are available in near future. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Rajashekharaiah K.M.M.; Chickerur S.; Hegde G.; Bhat S.L.; Sali S.A.,10.1007/978-3-031-35644-5_7,2023,Conference paper,Scopus,Aceito,,,Este artigo explora o uso da computação quântica aplicada ao processamento de linguagem natural (QNLP) para tarefas de classificação de sentenças.

Automated Vulnerability Detection in Source Code Using Quantum Natural Language Processing,"One of the most important challenges in the field of software code audit is the presence of vulnerabilities in software source code. Every year, more and more software flaws are found, either internally in proprietary code or revealed publicly. These flaws are highly likely exploited and lead to system compromise, data leakage, or denial of service. C and C++ open-source codes are now available in order to create a large-scale, classical machine-learning and quantum machine-learning system for function-level vulnerability identification. We assembled a sizable dataset of millions of open-source functions that point to potential exploits. We created an efficient and scalable vulnerability detection method based on a deep neural network model– Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and quantum machine learning model– Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM), that can learn features extracted from the source codes. The source code is first converted into a minimal intermediate representation to remove the pointless components and shorten the dependency. Previous studies lack analyzing features of the source code that causes models to recognize flaws in real-life examples. Therefore, We keep the semantic and syntactic information using state-of-the-art word embedding algorithms such as Glove and fastText. The embedded vectors are subsequently fed into the classical and quantum convolutional neural networks to classify the possible vulnerabilities. To measure the performance, we used evaluation metrics such as F1 score, precision, recall, accuracy, and total execution time. We made a comparison between the results derived from the classical LSTM and quantum LSTM using basic feature representation as well as semantic and syntactic representation. We found that the QLSTM with semantic and syntactic features detects significantly accurate vulnerability and runs faster than its classical counterpart. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Akter M.S.; Shahriar H.; Bhuiya Z.A.,10.1007/978-981-99-0272-9_6,2023,Conference paper,Scopus,Aceito,,,Este artigo propõe um sistema para detecção de vulnerabilidades em código-fonte (especialmente em C e C++) usando aprendizado de máquina clássico e quântico.,,,
Parts of speech tagging towards classical to quantum computing,"Quantum computing is a fast-emerging field that follows the laws of quantum mechanics to solve complex problems for classical systems. In the last few years, several researchers have emerged in quantum computing in accordance with the artificial intelligence field. Natural language processing is one of the prominent subfields of artificial intelligence. Quantum computing can be applied to the applications of natural language processing for better performance. One of the vital applications of natural language processing is Parts-Of-Speech (POS) tagging. It is prerequired for many natural language processing applications. In this paper, we have performed POS tagging of the Mizo language using classical Long short-term memory (LSTM). Subsequently, quantum-enhanced long short-term memory (QLSTM) has also been used to perform POS tagging of the Mizo language. The approaches mentioned above have been tested on the Mizo-tagged corpus, and experimental results have shown that quantum computing approaches such as QLSTM need the inclusion of new technologies to achieve significant results.  © 2022 IEEE.",Pandey S.; Dadure P.; Nunsanga M.V.L.; Pakray P.,10.1109/SILCON55242.2022.10028796,2022,Conference paper,Scopus,Aceito,,,Este artigo realiza etiquetagem de partes do discurso (POS tagging) para a língua Mizo,,,

String pattern recognition using evolving spiking neural networks and quantum inspired particle swarm optimization,This paper proposes a novel method for string pattern recognition using an Evolving Spiking Neural Network (ESNN) with Quantum-inspired Particle Swarm Optimization (QiPSO). This study reveals an interesting concept of QiPSO by representing information as binary structures. The mechanism optimizes the ESNN parameters and relevant features using the wrapper approach simultaneously. The N-gram kernel is used to map Reuters string datasets into high dimensional feature matrix which acts as an input to the proposed method.

Study of game theory mechanism for effective sentimental analysis using natural language processing,"Sentimental analysis of the data being created daily is a challenging task for machine learning and artificial intelligence to understand the human-generated data for further processing using the game theory. In the game theory, both positive and negative instances of the data are needed to understand so that better training can be given for the model using the pre-processed information. The positive and negative instances need to be managed by the model according to the understanding of the model. Machine learning algorithms will work more efficiently if the data is accurate. But the sentimental analysis is needed to understand without the properly aligned data in the proper order or format. The proper arrangement of the data can make a useful model for the game playing prediction. The experiment will give the result of the genre of the game the people are liking to play with respect to both positive and negative instance. The choice of the game will be based on human sentiments. An accuracy of 85% is got in the prediction to verify and predict the game the specific age group will like to opt.

WHEN BERT MEETS QUANTUM TEMPORAL CONVOLUTION LEARNING FOR TEXT CLASSIFICATION IN HETEROGENEOUS COMPUTING,"The rapid development of quantum computing has demonstrated many unique characteristics of quantum advantages, such as richer feature representation and more secured protection on model parameters. This work proposes a vertical federated learning architecture based on variational quantum circuits to demonstrate the competitive performance of a quantum-enhanced pre-trained BERT model for text classification. In particular, our proposed hybrid classical-quantum model consists of a novel random quantum temporal convolution (QTC) learning framework replacing some layers in the BERT-based decoder. Our experiments on intent classification show that our proposed BERT-QTC model attains competitive experimental results in the Snips and ATIS spoken language datasets. Particularly, the BERT-QTC boosts the performance of the existing quantum circuit-based language model in two text classification datasets by 1.57% and 1.52% relative improvements.

APPLICATION OF QUANTUM RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK IN LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE TEXT CLASSIFICATION,"TEXT SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IS AN IMPORTANT TASK IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HOT RESEARCH TOPIC. HOWEVER, IN LOW-RESOURCE REGIONS SUCH AS SOUTH ASIA, WHERE LANGUAGES LIKE BENGALI ARE WIDELY USED, THE RESEARCH INTEREST IS RELATIVELY LOW COMPARED TO HIGH-RESOURCE REGIONS DUE TO LIMITED COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES, FLEXIBLE WORD ORDER, AND HIGH INFLECTIONAL NATURE OF THE LANGUAGE. WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY, QUANTUM MACHINE LEARNING MODELS LEVERAGE THE SUPERPOSITION PROPERTY OF QUBITS TO ENHANCE MODEL EXPRESSIVENESS AND ACHIEVE FASTER COMPUTATION COMPARED TO CLASSICAL SYSTEMS. TO PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF QUANTUM MACHINE LEARNING IN LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE DOMAINS, WE PROPOSE A QUANTUM-CLASSICAL HYBRID ARCHITECTURE.

NEAR-TERM ADVANCES IN QUANTUM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING,"THIS PAPER DESCRIBES EXPERIMENTS SHOWING THAT SOME TASKS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) CAN ALREADY BE PERFORMED USING QUANTUM COMPUTERS, THOUGH SO FAR ONLY WITH SMALL DATASETS. WE DEMONSTRATE VARIOUS APPROACHES TO TOPIC CLASSIFICATION. THE FIRST USES AN EXPLICIT WORD-BASED APPROACH, IN WHICH WORD-TOPIC WEIGHTS ARE IMPLEMENTED AS FRACTIONAL ROTATIONS OF INDIVIDUAL QUBITS, AND A PHRASE IS CLASSIFIED BASED ON THE ACCUMULATION OF THESE WEIGHTS ONTO A SCORING QUBIT, USING ENTANGLING QUANTUM GATES. THIS IS COMPARED WITH MORE SCALABLE QUANTUM ENCODINGS OF WORD EMBEDDING VECTORS, WHICH ARE USED TO COMPUTE KERNEL VALUES IN A QUANTUM SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE: THIS APPROACH ACHIEVED AN AVERAGE OF 62\% ACCURACY ON CLASSIFICATION TASKS INVOLVING OVER 10000 WORDS, WHICH IS THE LARGEST SUCH QUANTUM COMPUTING EXPERIMENT TO DATE. WE DESCRIBE A QUANTUM PROBABILITY APPROACH TO BIGRAM MODELING THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO UNDERSTAND SEQUENCES OF WORDS AND FORMAL CONCEPTS, INVESTIGATE A GENERATIVE APPROXIMATION TO THESE DISTRIBUTIONS USING A QUANTUM CIRCUIT BORN MACHINE, AND INTRODUCE AN APPROACH TO AMBIGUITY RESOLUTION IN VERB-NOUN COMPOSITION USING SINGLE-QUBIT ROTATIONS FOR SIMPLE NOUNS AND 2-QUBIT ENTANGLING GATES FOR SIMPLE VERBS. THE SMALLER SYSTEMS PRESENTED HAVE BEEN RUN SUCCESSFULLY ON PHYSICAL QUANTUM COMPUTERS, AND THE LARGER ONES HAVE BEEN SIMULATED. WE SHOW THAT STATISTICALLY MEANINGFUL RESULTS CAN BE OBTAINED, BUT THE QUALITY OF INDIVIDUAL RESULTS VARIES MUCH MORE USING REAL DATASETS THAN USING ARTIFICIAL LANGUAGE EXAMPLES FROM PREVIOUS QUANTUM NLP RESEARCH.

QUANTUM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING: A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY,"BY USING THE QUANTUM MECHANICS PHENOMENON, QUANTUM COMPUTERS PROVIDE A NEW DIMENSION OF COMPUTATIONAL POWER THAT DRASTICALLY ACCELERATES SOLVING COMPLEX AND RESOURCE-INTENSIVE PROBLEMS. ONE OF THE MOST EVOLVING BUT, DUE TO THE COMPUTATION POWER OF STANDARD COMPUTERS, REASONABLY LIMITED APPLICATION DOMAIN IS NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP). NLP SEEKS TO GIVE INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND AND MANIPULATE HUMAN LANGUAGE. MAKING SYSTEMS UNDERSTAND AND MANIPULATE HUMAN LANGUAGES REQUIRES LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA AND COMPUTATIONAL POWER DURING LEARNING AS WELL AS DURING THE EXECUTION OF NLP. FOR HANDLING THESE AMOUNTS OF DATA LIKE TEXT AND AUDIO RECORDINGS AND THE COMPLEXITY OF CLASSICAL NLP ALGORITHMS, QUANTUM COMPUTATION HAS EMERGED AS A PROMISING SOLUTION. THIS WORK GIVES AN EXTENSIVE OVERVIEW OF THIS NEW FIELD, KNOWN AS QUANTUM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (QNLP). INTRODUCING THE BASICS OF QUANTUM COMPUTING, WE DISCUSS ITS USE IN NLP BY EXPLAINING THE DIFFERENT PROPOSED EMBEDDING MODELS, QUANTUM ALGORITHMS, AND OTHER METHODS OF QNLP.

ENSEMBLE LEARNING BASED QUANTUM TEXT CLASSIFIERS,"QUANTUM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (QNLP) IS A VERY YOUNG AREA OF RESEARCH, AIMED AT THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NLP MODELS THAT EXPLOIT CERTAIN QUANTUM PHENOMENA SUCH AS SUPERPOSITION, ENTANGLEMENT, AND INTERFERENCE TO PERFORM LANGUAGE-RELATED TASKS ON QUANTUM HARDWARE. TO EXPLORE THE STRUCTURAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN QUANTUM THEORY AND NATURAL LANGUAGES LAMBEQ TOOLKIT WAS CREATED. THIS FIRST HIGH-LEVEL OPEN-SOURCE PYTHON TOOLKIT FOR QUANTUM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING OFFERS A FULLY AUTOMATED QUANTUM MACHINE LEARNING PIPELINE. LAMBEQ CURRENTLY INCLUDES FIVE COMPOSITIONAL MODELS THAT USE VARYING DEGREES OF SYNTACTIC INFORMATION. WHILE THE PREVIOUS STUDIES FOCUS ON DISCOCAT MODEL, THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO CONDUCTE AN EXTENSIVE EVALUATION OF VARIOUS CLASSIFIERS BASED ON DIFFERENT COMPOSITIONAL MODELS FOR TEXT CLASSIFICATION APPLICATIONS, FOCUSING ON THE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES OF ENSEMBLE LEARNING. THE CLASSIFIERS, INCLUDING SPIDER, CUPS, STAIRS, TREE, AND DISCOCAT, WERE EXAMINED ON TWO DATASETS: MC AND RP. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION WAS CARRIED OUT USING ACCURACY, PRECISION, RECALL, AND F1-SCORE AS THE METRICS. THE RESULTS REVEALED NOTABLE VARIATIONS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CLASSIFIERS ACROSS THE DATASETS. SPIDER EMERGED AS THE TOP-PERFORMING CLASSIFIER ON THE MC DATASET, ACHIEVING REMARKABLE SCORES OF 100\% IN ACCURACY, PRECISION, RECALL, AND F1-SCORE. HOWEVER, ON THE RP DATASET, STAIRS OUTPERFORMED THE OTHER CLASSIFIERS WITH AN ACCURACY OF 68\%, PRECISION OF 71\%, RECALL OF 68\%, AND F1-SCORE OF 69\%. FURTHERMORE, ENSEMBLE MODELS USING HARD VOTING AND SOFT VOTING TECHNIQUES WERE CONSTRUCTED AND EVALUATED. THE ENSEMBLE MODELS SHOWCASED IMPROVED PERFORMANCE COMPARED TO INDIVIDUAL CLASSIFIERS, WITH THE SOFT VOTING ENSEMBLE ACHIEVING A SCORE OF 97\% FOR ALL METRICS ON THE MC DATASET, AND A PRECISION OF 72\% AND F1-SCORE OF 68\% ON THE RP DATASET.

THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY INVESTIGATES HOW SENTIMENT CAN BE REPRESENTED CORRECTLY AND EFFICIENTLY FOR QUANTUM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (QNLP). IN PARTICULAR, WE PRESENT FOUR POSSIBLE APPROACHES FOR REPRESENTING SENTIMENT WORDS IN THE QUANTUM CASE. WE PROPOSE TO UTILIZE TWO QUANTUM OPERATIONS (I.E., X GATE AND Z-X GATE), EACH WITH TWO DIFFERENT PLACEMENTS, TO REPRESENT A NEGATIVE SENTENCE IN A QUANTUM CIRCUIT. SUBSEQUENTLY, WE TRAIN THE CORRESPONDING STATE VECTOR USING SEVERAL CLASSICAL CLASSIFIERS: SVM, SPSA, AND A COMBINATION OF BOTH, THEN EVALUATE THE RESULT IN TERMS OF ACCURACY. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE THIRD APPROACH, I.E., ADDING AN X-GATE AT THE END OF THE SENTENCE OUTPERFORMS OTHER SETTINGS.

QUANTUM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING APPLICATION FOR ESTIMATING SQL QUERY METRICS,"QUANTUM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (QNLP) IS BUILT ON A NOVEL, CATEGORY THEORETICAL QUANTUM MACHINE LEARNING MODEL, WHICH WE USE TO SOLVE A WELL-RESEARCHED PROBLEM IN THE DATABASE FIELD: ESTIMATING METRICS FOR SQL QUERIES. THE METRICS WE FOCUS ON ARE LATENCY (I.E., THE EXECUTION TIME), COST (I.E., A VALUE OF HOW EXPENSIVE THE QUERY IS IN TOTAL), AND CARDINALITY (I.E., THE NUMBER OF ROWS IN THE RESULT TABLE). THE CRITICAL LINK BETWEEN QNLP AND THE DATABASE PROBLEM LIES IN USING GRAMMARS, SUCH AS CONTEXT-FREE GRAMMAR. BOTH NATURAL LANGUAGE AND SQL QUERIES ADMIT GRAMMATICAL PRESENTATIONS, WHICH ALLOW US TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR APPLYING QNLP METHODS TO SOLVE THE QUERY ESTIMATION PROBLEM. THE MODEL COMPRISES AN ENCODING MECHANISM AND A TRAINING PHASE, INTEGRATING CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM SUBROUTINES. THE ENCODING MECHANISM TRANSFORMS SQL QUERIES INTO PARAMETRIZED QUANTUM CIRCUITS AS IN QNLP. CLASSICAL OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS OPTIMIZE THE CIRCUIT PARAMETERS DURING TRAINING TO PREDICT QUERY METRICS. COMPARING OUR MODEL TO THE QNLP MODELS, OUR MODEL ACHIEVES ACCURACY COMPARABLE TO THE QNLP MODEL IN BINARY CLASSIFICATION TASKS. ADDITIONALLY, WE EXPAND UPON PREVIOUS RESEARCH BY IMPLEMENTING MULTI-CLASS CLASSIFICATION TASKS AND COMPARING THE CARDINALITY ESTIMATION RESULTS TO THOSE OF STATE-OF-THE-ART DATABASES.

HYBRID CLASSICAL-QUANTUM TRANSFER LEARNING FOR TEXT CLASSIFICATION,"QUANTUM MACHINE LEARNING (QML) IS A PROMISING FIELD THAT COMBINES THE POWER OF QUANTUM COMPUTING WITH MACHINE LEARNING. VARIATIONAL QUANTUM CIRCUITS, WHERE PARAMETERS OF CIRCUITS ARE LEARNED CLASSICALLY, HAVE BEEN WIDELY USED IN MANY RECENT APPLICATIONS OF QML. THIS IS AN INSTANCE OF A HYBRID QUANTUM-CLASSICAL FRAMEWORK, WHERE BOTH CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM COMPONENTS ARE PRESENT.

A QUANTUM-LIKE ZERO-SHOT APPROACH FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IN FINANCE,"SENTIMENT ANALYSIS HAS BECOME AN INDISPENSABLE TOOL ACROSS VARIOUS DOMAINS, INCLUDING POLITICAL COMMUNICATION, MARKETING ANALYTICS, AND FINANCE. IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR, SENTIMENTS SUCH AS CONFIDENCE OR FEAR PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE IN SHAPING MARKET DYNAMICS, INFLUENCING SUPPLY AND DEMAND, AND PRECIPITATING SIGNIFICANT PRICE FLUCTUATIONS. THE TIMELY EXTRACTION OF SENTIMENT FROM SOURCES LIKE FINANCIAL NEWS ARTICLES AND SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS IS CRUCIAL FOR DEVISING INFORMED INVESTMENT STRATEGIES. DESPITE ITS IMPORTANCE, CURRENT APPROACHES TO SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IN FINANCE HAVE NOT FULLY HARNESSED THE POTENTIAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (LLMS) AND QUANTUM COMPUTING MODELS. THESE CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED REMARKABLE SUCCESS IN OTHER AREAS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP), BUT THEIR APPLICATION IN FINANCIAL SENTIMENT ANALYSIS REMAINS LIMITED. THIS PAPER AIMS TO BRIDGE THIS GAP BY INTRODUCING A NOVEL QUANTUM MODEL FOR TEXT REPRESENTATION, SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THE FINANCIAL DOMAIN. OUR APPROACH INTEGRATES THIS QUANTUM REPRESENTATION WITH A VECTOR-BASED REPRESENTATION GENERATED BY A PRE-TRAINED LLM SPECIALIZED IN FINANCE.

IT AIMS TO REDUCE THE MEMORY CONSUMPTION OF CLASSICAL MODELS FOR VULNERABILITY DETECTION TASKS AND IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF QUANTUM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (QNLP) METHODS. WE SHOW THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF RQENN ACHIEVES THE ABOVE GOALS. COMPARED WITH THE CLASSIC MODEL, THE SPACE COMPLEXITY OF EACH STAGE OF ITS EXECUTION IS EXPONENTIALLY REDUCED, AND THE NUMBER OF PARAMETERS USED AND THE NUMBER OF BITS CONSUMED ARE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED.

PRESENTLY, COMPLEX-VALUED NEURAL NETWORKS HAVE BEEN STUDIED, BUT THEIR PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS ARE FEW, LET ALONE IN THE DOWNSTREAM TASKS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING SUCH AS SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND LANGUAGE MODELING. IN FACT, THE COMPLEX-VALUED NEURAL NETWORK CAN USE THE IMAGINARY PART INFORMATION TO EMBED HIDDEN INFORMATION AND CAN EXPRESS MORE COMPLEX INFORMATION, WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR MODELING COMPLEX NATURAL LANGUAGE. MEANWHILE, QUANTUM-INSPIRED MODELS ARE DEFINED IN HILBERT SPACE, WHICH IS ALSO A COMPLEX SPACE. SO IT IS NATURAL TO CONSTRUCT QUANTUM-INSPIRED MODELS BASED ON COMPLEX-VALUED NEURAL NETWORKS.

THIS RESEARCH PAPER PRESENTS A NOVEL APPROACH TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE STAFFING AND RECRUITING INDUSTRY BY INTEGRATING KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (KG) AND QUANTUM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (QNLP) TO FORMULATE AN END-TO-END QNLP TRAINING PIPELINE. THE PROPOSED SOLUTION CONSISTS OF THREE INTERDEPENDENT SUBSYSTEMS THAT WORK IN UNISON TO CONSTRUCT CONTEXTUAL KG AND TRAIN LANGUAGE MODELS. THE INFORMATION EXTRACTION SUBSYSTEM EXTRACTS SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS AND CONNECTIONS BETWEEN ENTITIES FROM LARGE AND COMPLEX RECRUITMENT DATA TO CONSTRUCT DOMAIN SPECIFIC CONTEXTUAL KG.

A TOPIC-AWARE CLASSIFIER BASED ON A HYBRID QUANTUM-CLASSICAL MODEL,"IN THE ERA OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS, THERE IS STILL POTENTIAL FOR IMPROVEMENT IN CURRENT NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) METHODS IN TERMS OF VERIFIABILITY AND CONSISTENCY. NLP CLASSICAL APPROACHES ARE COMPUTATIONALLY EXPENSIVE DUE TO THEIR HIGH-POWER CONSUMPTION, COMPUTING POWER, AND STORAGE REQUIREMENTS. ANOTHER COMPUTATIONALLY EFFICIENT APPROACH TO NLP IS CATEGORICAL QUANTUM MECHANICS, WHICH COMBINES GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURE AND INDIVIDUAL WORD MEANING TO DEDUCE THE SENTENCE MEANING. AS BOTH QUANTUM THEORY AND NATURAL LANGUAGE USE VECTOR SPACE TO DESCRIBE STATES WHICH ARE MORE EFFICIENT ON QUANTUM HARDWARE, QNLP MODELS CAN ACHIEVE UP TO QUADRATIC SPEEDUP OVER CLASSICAL DIRECT CALCULATION METHODS. IN RECENT YEARS, THERE IS SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN UTILIZING QUANTUM FEATURES SUCH AS SUPERPOSITION AND ENTANGLEMENT TO REPRESENT LINGUISTIC MEANING ON QUANTUM HARDWARE. EARLIER RESEARCH WORK HAS ALREADY DEMONSTRATED QNLP'S POTENTIAL QUANTUM ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF SPEEDING UP SEARCH, ENHANCING CLASSIFICATION TASKS' ACCURACY AND PROVIDING AN EXPONENTIALLY LARGE QUANTUM STATE SPACE IN WHICH COMPLEX LINGUISTIC STRUCTURES CAN BE EFFICIENTLY EMBEDDED. IN THIS WORK, A QNLP MODEL IS USED TO DETERMINE IF TWO SENTENCES ARE RELATED TO THE SAME TOPIC OR NOT. BY COMPARING OUR QNLP MODEL TO A CLASSICAL TENSOR NETWORK-BASED ONE, OUR MODEL IMPROVED TRAINING ACCURACY BY UP TO 45\% AND VALIDATION ACCURACY BY 35\%, RESPECTIVELY.

EXPLOITING THE FORMAL SIMILARITY OF THE COMPOSITIONAL MODEL OF MEANING BY COECKE, SADRZADEH , CLARK SPECIALINTSCRIPT WITH QUANTUM THEORY, WE CREATE REPRESENTATIONS FOR SENTENCES THAT HAVE A NATURAL MAP-PING TO QUANTUM CIRCUITS.

QUANTUM WORD EMBEDDING FOR MACHINE LEARNING,"THE ACCELERATED PROGRESS IN QUANTUM COMPUTING HAS ENABLED A NEW FORM OF MACHINE INTELLIGENCE THAT RUNS ON QUANTUM HARDWARE, WHICH HOLDS GREAT PROMISE FOR MORE POWERFUL COMPUTATIONAL MODELS IN VARIOUS LEARNING TASKS. AN EMERGENT APPLICATION OF QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE (QMI) IS QUANTUM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (QNLP). THIS PAPER PROPOSES A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL, FINITE AUTOMATON MODEL FOR QUANTUM WORD EMBEDDING (QWE) VIA THE GALOIS FIELD. WE DEMONSTRATED THE MODEL TO THREE APPLICATIONS: (1) ENGLISH VOCABULARY, (2) AMINO ACID-BASED GENETIC CODES, AND (3) DNA-BASED GENETIC CODES. THE NUMERICAL RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM FOR THE ENGLISH VOCABULARY INDICATE THAT IT PRODUCES MORE REPRESENTATIVE WORD FEATURES THAN WORD2VEC BASED ON THE WORD DISTANCE METRIC.

LARGE SCALE STRUCTURE-AWARE PRONOUN RESOLUTION USING QUANTUM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING,"NATURAL LANGUAGE CONSISTS OF WORDS, SENTENCES, AND LARGER UNITS. GUIDED BY GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURE, WORDS COMPOSE WITH EACH OTHER TO FORM SENTENCES. SIMILARLY, GUIDED BY DISCOURSE STRUCTURE, SENTENCES COMPOSE WITH EACH OTHER TO FORM DIALOGUES AND DOCUMENTS. CLASSICAL MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS HAVE ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS IN LEARNING THE MEANINGS OF WORDS. WHEN IT COMES TO MEANINGS OF SENTENCES AND DISCOURSE UNITS, THEY HOWEVER FALL SHORT OF BEING COMPOSITIONAL. THE DISCOCAT MODEL OF MEANING, INTRODUCED BY CLARK, COECKE, AND SADRZADEH IN 2010, PROVIDES A SOLUTION-AT THE SENTENCE LEVEL-USING HIGHER-ORDER TENSORS, THE LEARNING OF WHICH HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE. A RECENT INITIATIVE KNOWN AS QUANTUM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (QNLP) INTRODUCES A TRANSLATION BETWEEN THE DISCOCAT TENSORS AND VARIATIONAL QUANTUM CIRCUITS (VQC). THIS OFFERS THE POTENTIAL OF LEARNING THESE HIGHER-ORDER TENSORS MORE EFFICIENTLY WHEN THE CIRCUITS ARE EXECUTED ON QUANTUM COMPUTERS. IN PREVIOUS WORK, WE LIFTED THE DISCOCAT FRAMEWORK FROM THE SENTENCE LEVEL TO THE DISCOURSE LEVEL USING A FOCK SPACE SEMANTICS. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXTEND THE DISCOCAT-VQC TRANSLATION TO THIS SEMANTICS AND EXPERIMENT WITH IT IN A DISCOURSE TASK. WE DEVELOP A MASSIVE DATASET WITH 16,400 ENTRIES INSPIRED BY A MAJOR COREFERENCE RESOLUTION TASK, KNOWN AS THE WINOGRAD SCHEMA CHALLENGE, PROPOSED AS A TEST OF MACHINE INTELLIGENCE. NOISY AND NOISELESS SIMULATIONS WERE EXECUTED ON IBMQ SOFTWARE, AND THE PARAMETERS OF THE DISCOURSE VQCS WERE LEARNT.

EXPLAINABLE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING WITH MATRIX PRODUCT STATES,"DESPITE EMPIRICAL SUCCESSES OF RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS (RNNS) IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP), THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING OF RNNS IS STILL LIMITED DUE TO INTRINSICALLY COMPLEX NON-LINEAR COMPUTATIONS. WE SYSTEMATICALLY ANALYZE RNNS' BEHAVIORS IN A UBIQUITOUS NLP TASK, THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF MOVIE REVIEWS, VIA THE MAPPING BETWEEN A CLASS OF RNNS CALLED RECURRENT ARITHMETIC CIRCUITS (RACS) AND A MATRIX PRODUCT STATE. USING THE VON-NEUMANN ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY (EE) AS A PROXY FOR INFORMATION PROPAGATION, WE SHOW THAT SINGLE-LAYER RACS POSSESS A MAXIMUM INFORMATION PROPAGATION CAPACITY, REFLECTED BY THE SATURATION OF THE EE. ENLARGING THE BOND DIMENSION BEYOND THE EE SATURATION THRESHOLD DOES NOT INCREASE MODEL PREDICTION ACCURACIES, SO A MINIMAL MODEL THAT BEST ESTIMATES THE DATA STATISTICS CAN BE INFERRED. ALTHOUGH THE SATURATED EE IS SMALLER THAN THE MAXIMUM EE ALLOWED BY THE AREA LAW, OUR MINIMAL MODEL STILL ACHIEVES SIMILAR TO 99\% TRAINING ACCURACIES IN REALISTIC SENTIMENT ANALYSIS DATA SETS.

AT THE SAME TIME, QUANTUM COMPUTERS HAVE BECOME MUCH MORE POWERFUL, AND ANNOUNCEMENTS OF MAJOR ADVANCES ARE FREQUENTLY IN THE NEWS. THE MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES UNDERLYING BOTH THESE AREAS HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN IS SOMETIMES REALIZED. VECTOR SPACES TOOK A POSITION AT THE AXIOMATIC HEART OF QUANTUM MECHANICS IN THE 1930S, AND THIS ADOPTION WAS A KEY MOTIVATION FOR THE DERIVATION OF LOGIC AND PROBABILITY FROM THE LINEAR GEOMETRY OF VECTOR SPACES.

QUANTUM ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED NODE LOCALIZATION TECHNIQUE FOR WIRELESS NETWORKS,"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) TECHNIQUES HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION AMONG RESEARCH COMMUNITIES IN THE FIELD OF NETWORKING, IMAGE PROCESSING, NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING, ROBOTICS, ETC. AT THE SAME TIME, A MAJOR PROBLEM IN WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS (WSN) IS NODE LOCALIZATION, WHICH AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE EXACT POSITION OF THE SENSOR NODES (SN) USING THE KNOWN POSITION OF SEVERAL ANCHOR NODES. WSN COMPRISES A MASSIVE NUMBER OF SNS AND RECORDS THE POSITION OF THE NODES, WHICH BECOMES A TEDIOUS PROCESS. BESIDES, THE SNS MIGHT BE SUBJECTED TO NODE MOBILITY AND THE POSITION ALTERS WITH TIME. SO, A PRECISE NODE LOCALIZATION (NL) MANNER IS REQUIRED FOR DETERMINING THE LOCATION OF THE SNS. IN THIS VIEW, THIS PAPER PRESENTS A NEW QUANTUM BIRD MIGRATION OPTIMIZER-BASED NL (QBMA-NL) TECHNIQUE FOR WSN.

"A MULTIMODAL MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH TO DIAGNOSIS, PROGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT PREDICTION FOR NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES AND CANCER","DESPITE EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND ESTIMATING THE FUTURE COURSE OF NEURODEGENERATIVE AND CANCEROUS DISEASES BEING INTEGRAL FOR SURVIVAL OF PATIENTS, CLINICAL AND ALGORITHMIC METHODS FAIL TO EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE THE MULTIMODAL DATA AVAILABLE, ARE TIME-INEFFICIENT, AND EXPENSIVE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO ACCESS ACCURATE SCREENINGS FOR THESE DISEASES. THEREFORE, A NOVEL END-TO-END QUANTUM MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH USING MULTIPLE DATA MODALITIES FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF DIAGNOSES, PROGNOSES, AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS IS PROPOSED. IN A PROCEDURAL FLOW, DATA IS SOURCED FROM ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: CT SCAN IMAGES, WEBCAM, PATIENT-PHYSICIAN AUDIO, WHOLE SLIDE IMAGES, AND CLINICAL DATA. FOR IMAGE DATA, A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK, IS EMPLOYED TO DETECT HIGH LEVEL FEATURES. WITH TEXT-BASED CLINICAL DATA (INCLUDING AUDIO-DERIVED DATA), A BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER REPRESENTATION MODEL IS USED TO EXTRACT TEXT EMBEDDINGS. FOR VIDEO DATA, PUPIL PROGRESSION AND AVERAGE FIXATION DURATION FEATURES ARE MANUALLY CRAFTED. ALL FEATURE VECTORS ARE CONCATENATED, NORMALIZED, PASSED THROUGH A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK, AND THEN MAPPED TO ONE OF 38 NEURODEGENERATIVE AND CANCEROUS DISEASES. FOR PROGNOSIS, FEATURES ARE POOLED, CONCATENATED WITH THE DIAGNOSIS FEATURE VECTOR, AND PASSED THROUGH ANOTHER NEURAL NETWORK WITH AN OUTPUT OF SURVIVAL TIMES. TREATMENT PREDICTION INVOLVES AN INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL TASK MATCHING FEATURE VECTORS TO TREATMENTS/DRUG LISTS FROM THE FDA. THE PROPOSED APPROACH WAS TESTED ON 5,000 PATIENT PROFILES SOURCED FROM THE PUBLIC TCGA AND JPND DATABASES, OUTPERFORMING ALL OTHER STATE-OF-THE-ART APPROACHES.

"THE DIGITAL TEXT WORKSHOP CLOUD, NEW SOLUTIONS FOR SUPER CALCULATION ENVIRONMENTS","QUANTUM PHYSICS IS THE BASIS OF SCIENTIFIC THINKING AND INFLUENCES THE MIND. WENDT [1] IN QUANTUM MIND AND SOCIAL SCIENCE ARGUES THAT THE MIND AND SOCIAL LIFE ARE MACROSCOPIC PHENOMENA OF QUANTUM MECHANICS AND THAT THE QUANTUM CONSCIOUSNESS HYPOTHESIS IS THE COGNITIVE BASIS OF A QUANTUM SOCIAL SCIENCE. IN THESE NEW SCIENTIFIC PARAMETERS OF KNOWLEDGE, OUR VISUALIZATION MATRIX IS ESSENTIALLY A HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION. RESEARCH INNOVATION LIES IN SEEKING THE POINT OF CONVERGENCE TO DESCRIBE A FORMAL PROCESS THAT, AS A MULTI-CODE PROCESS, GOES FROM A PHASE OF JOINED SENTENCES TO A DATA IMPLEMENTATION PHASE, PLANAT OF THE INSTITUTE OF FEMTO -ST DEP. OF MICRO NANO SCIENCES AND SYSTEMS, BESANCON, FRANCE. THE GOAL IS TO FIND POINTS OF CONTACT BETWEEN QUANTUM PHYSICS, COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS, AND QUANTUM COMPUTING. PLANAT [2] STATES THAT THE QUALITY THAT THE LINGUIST MUST POSSESS BEYOND COURAGE IS. COMPETENCE TO TRANSCRIBE MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS INTO GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURES. THIS ASSUMPTION IS AT THE BASIS OF OUR STUDY. THE TOOLS ARE 1) IDENTIFYING NEW PARAMETERS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FIXED STRUCTURES IDENTIFIED IN THE PLANAT MODELMATHEMATICAL THEORIES; 2) USING CHARLES BAUDELAIRE'S NARRATIVE TEXT [3] TO CLARIFY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE VERB IN THE SENTENCE THROUGH THE RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENTATION METHOD INTO A LOCAL GRAMMAR; 3) UTILIZING MAX SILBERZTEIN'S NOOJ SYSTEM [4], FOR THE PRODUCTION OF SENTENCE ANALYSIS AND PARAPHRASES, TOOLS FOR DEVELOPING FORMAL DICTIONARIES AND GRAMMARS, AND NLP APPLICATIONS SUCH AS SEMANTIC ANNOTATORS; 4) DEVELOPING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ADVANCED INTEGRATED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR THE CREATION OF KNOWLEDGE FROM OBTAINED DATA; 5) APPLYING THE BUVITEMS ((C) 2020) AWDIGITAL INTELLIGENCE MODEL FOR THE PRODUCTION OF EDITED, REFORMULATED AND TRANSLATED SENTENCES USING A MIXED SYSTEM. THUS, THE ENTIRE FORMAL PROCESS WILL MAKE USE OF: 1 LEXICON-GRAMMATICAL TO TRANSFER THE NUMERICAL QUANTUM LANGUAGE INTO A LEXICON-GRAMMATICAL CODE; 2 THE NOOJ'S ENVIRONMENT TO GENERATE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND GRAPHS.",VERONESI ILARIA;BUCCIARELLI RITA;TORTORIELLO FRANCESCO; SAVERIO;RODRIGO ANDREA;GRECO MARIANNA;LA RAGIONE COLOMBA;JULIAN ENRIQUEZ JAVIER,10.1007/978-3-031-23317-3\_17,2022,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,ISI,Aceito,,,"O artigo explora a interseção entre física quântica, linguística computacional e computação quântica, propondo um framework formal para mapear conceitos matemáticos em estruturas gramaticais.

RECOGNIZING BEAM PROFILES FROM SILICON PHOTONICS GRATINGS USING A TRANSFORMER MODEL,"OVER THE PAST DECADE, THERE HAS BEEN EXTENSIVE WORK IN DEVELOPING INTEGRATED SILICON PHOTONICS (SIPH) GRATINGS FOR THE OPTICAL ADDRESSING OF TRAPPED ION QUBITS AMONG THE ION TRAP QUANTUM COMPUTING COMMUNITY. HOWEVER, WHEN VIEWING BEAM PROFILES FROM GRATINGS USING INFRARED (IR) CAMERAS, IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE CORRESPONDING HEIGHTS WHERE THE BEAM PROFILES ARE LOCATED. IN THIS WORK, WE DEVELOPED TRANSFORMER MODELS TO RECOGNIZE THE CORRESPONDING HEIGHT CATEGORIES OF BEAM PROFILES IN LIGHT FROM SIPH GRATINGS. THE MODELS ARE TRAINED USING TWO TECHNIQUES: (1) INPUT PATCHES AND (2) INPUT SEQUENCE. FOR THE MODEL TRAINED WITH INPUT PATCHES, THE MODEL ACHIEVED A RECOGNITION ACCURACY OF 0.924. MEANWHILE, THE MODEL TRAINED WITH INPUT SEQUENCE SHOWS A LOWER ACCURACY OF 0.892. HOWEVER, WHEN REPEATING THE MODEL TRAINING FOR 150 CYCLES, A MODEL TRAINED WITH INPUT PATCHES SHOWS INCONSISTENT ACCURACY RANGES BETWEEN 0.289 TO 0.959, WHILE THE MODEL TRAINED WITH INPUT SEQUENCE SHOWS ACCURACY VALUES BETWEEN 0.75 TO 0.947. THE OBTAINED OUTCOMES CAN BE EXPANDED TO VARIOUS APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING AUTO-FOCUSING OF LIGHT BEAMS AND AUTO-ADJUSTMENT OF THE Z-AXIS STAGE TO ACQUIRE DESIRED BEAM PROFILES.
