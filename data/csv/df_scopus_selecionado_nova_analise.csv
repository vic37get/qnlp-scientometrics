Nonetheless, certain computational tasks in drug discovery can be daunting with classical computing techniques which can be potentially overcome using quantum computing. A crucial task within this domain involves the functional classification of proteins. However, a challenge lies in adequately representing lengthy protein sequences given the limited number of qubits available in existing noisy quantum computers. We show that protein sequences can be thought of as sentences in natural language processing and can be parsed using the existing Quantum Natural Language framework into parameterized quantum circuits of reasonable qubits, which can be trained to solve various protein-related machine-learning problems. We classify proteins based on their sub-cellular locations - a pivotal task in bioinformatics that is key to understanding biological processes and disease mechanisms. Leveraging the quantum-enhanced processing capabilities, we demonstrate that Quantum Tensor Networks (QTN) can effectively handle the complexity and diversity of protein sequences. We present a detailed methodology that adapts QTN architectures to the nuanced requirements of protein data, supported by comprehensive experimental results. We demonstrate two distinct QTNs, inspired by classical recurrent neural networks (RNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), to solve the binary classification task mentioned above. Our top-performing quantum model has achieved a 94% accuracy rate, which is comparable to the performance of a classical model that uses the ESM2 protein language model embeddings. It's noteworthy that the ESM2 model is extremely large, containing 8 million parameters in its smallest configuration, whereas our best quantum model requires only around 800 parameters. We demonstrate that these hybrid models exhibit promising performance, showcasing their potential to compete with classical models of similar complexity. © 2024 ACM.",Protein Sequence Classification; Quantum Machine Learning; Quantum Neural Network,Classification (of information); Complex networks; Convolutional neural networks; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Qubits; Recurrent neural networks; Tensors; Drug discovery; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Performance; Protein sequence classification; Protein sequences; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum models; Quantum neural networks; Proteins,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (DGE-1723687, CNS-1722557, DGE-1821766, CCF-1718474, OIA-2040667); National Science Foundation, NSF","We extend our gratitude to Avimita Chatterjee (Pennsylvania State University) for her valuable insights and assistance in structuring the work.

Models like fastText [1], [2], GloVe [3], Numberbatch [4], or BERT [5] are common NLP embedding vectors or models that encode semantic properties of words or text fragments. We use these models to evaluate mapping properties and compression rate, as well as information preservation in quantum embeddings. For mapping embedding vectors to quantum states, we use encoding strategies, such as Amplitude Encoding. The encoding strategies allow us to map large dense vectors from the embedding models to compact quantum states using different compression ratios. The compression with Amplitude Encoding can be 2n to N, resulting in a mapping of a 1,024-dimensional vector of reals in the classical environment to a 10-qubit state. The goal of this work is to evaluate these strategies with respect to their compression ratio and measure the preservation of semantic information using similarity scores. We show that the resulting quantum embeddings based on mapped classical computing embeddings exhibit the same relational properties and that there is no significant loss of semantic information in the conversion from classical n-dimensional real vector embeddings to qubit states. We conclude that the experimental results allow us to quantum compute semantic similarities of words or text, reusing existing and freely available embedding models from classical NLP/AI computing. © 2024 IEEE.",Natural Language Processing; Quantum Embeddings; Semantic Similarity; Word embeddings,Computation theory; Embeddings; Gluing; Human computer interaction; Natural language processing systems; Quantum electronics; Qubits; Semantics; Vectors; Word processing; Embeddings; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Quantum embedding; Quantum state; Real vector; Semantic similarity; Word embedding; Encoding (symbols),,,,,,,"Bojanowski P., Grave E., Joulin A., Mikolov T., Enriching word vectors with subword information, Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 5, pp. 135-146, (2017); Joulin A., Bojanowski P., Mikolov T., Jegou H., Grave E., Loss in translation: Learning bilingual word mapping with a retrieval criterion, Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, (2018); Pennington J., Socher R., Manning C.D., Glove: Global vectors for word representation, Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 1532-1543, (2014); Speer R., Chin J., Havasi C., ConceptNet 5. 5: An open multilingual graph of general knowledge, pp. 4444-4451, (2017); Devlin J., Chang M.-W., Lee K., Toutanova K., BERT: Pretraining of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Lenci A., Sahlgren M., Distributional semantics, (2023); Rath M., Date H., Quantum data encoding: A comparative analysis of classical-to-quantum mapping techniques and their impact on machine learning accuracy, (2023); Buhrman H., Cleve R., Watrous J., De Wolf R., Quantum Fingerprinting, Physical Review Letters, 87, 16, (2001); Araujo I.F., Park D.K., Petruccione F., Da Silva A.J., A divideand-conquer algorithm for quantum state preparation, Scientific Reports, 11, 1, (2021); Pastorello D., Blanzieri E., A quantum binary classifier based on cosine similarity, 2021 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE), pp. 477-478, (2021); Vaswani A., Shazeer N., Parmar N., Uszkoreit J., Jones L., Gomez A.N., Kaiser L., Polosukhin I., Attention is all you need, (2023); Goodfellow I., Bengio Y., Courville A., Deep Learning., (2016)",,Culhane C.; Byrd G.T.; Muller H.; Alexeev Y.; Alexeev Y.; Sheldon S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,et al.; Keysight; Microsoft; Q-CTRL; QBLOX; Quantinuum,"5th IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2024",15 September 2024 through 20 September 2024,Montreal,205980.0,,979-833154137-8,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Quantum Week , QCE",Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85217179460

Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) introduces probabilistic reasoning into the KG context. This integration leverages quantum principles, such as superposition, which allows relationships to exist in multiple states simultaneously, and entanglement, where the state of one entity dynamically influences the state of another. This quantum-based probabilistic reasoning provides a richer, more flexible representation of connections, moving beyond binary relationships to model the nuances and variability of real-world interactions. Our research demonstrates that QNLP enhances Neo4j's ability to analyze context-rich data, improving tasks like entity extraction and knowledge inference. By modeling relationship states probabilistically, QNLP addresses limitations in traditional methods, providing nuanced insights and enabling more advanced, context-aware NLP applications. © 2024 IEEE.",KGs; LLM; Neo4j; NLP; QNLP,Economic and social effects; Latent semantic analysis; Natural language processing systems; Quantum entanglement; Semantics; Contextual understanding; High-dimensional; Knowledge graphs; Language processing; LLM; Natural languages; Neo4j; Probabilistic reasoning; Quantum natural language processing; Traditional knowledge; Knowledge graph,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (2413540, 2100115)","The work is partially supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under awards #2413540 and #2100115.

This has led to great interest in quantum natural language processing, and several early proposals and experiments. This paper surveys the state of this area, showing how NLP-related techniques have been used in quantum language processing. We examine the art of word embeddings and sequential models, proposing some avenues for future investigation and discussing the tradeoffs present in these directions. We also highlight some recent methods to compute attention in transformer models, and perform grammatical parsing. We also introduce a new quantum design for the basic task of text encoding (representing a string of characters in memory), which has not been addressed in detail before. Quantum theory has contributed toward quantifying uncertainty and explaining “What is intelligence?” In this context, we argue that “hallucinations” in modern artificial intelligence systems are a misunderstanding of the way facts are conceptualized: language can express many plausible hypotheses, of which only a few become actual. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany and Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V. 2024.",QNLP; Quantum AI; Quantum language processing; Quantum string encoding,Economic and social effects; Encoding (symbols); Natural language processing systems; Quantum optics; Signal encoding; 'current; Encodings; Language processing; Natural languages; QNLP; Quanta computers; Quantum AI; Quantum language processing; Quantum string encoding; Quantum strings; Quantum computers,,,,,,,"Van Rijsbergen C.J., The Geometry of Information Retrieval, (2004); Sordoni A., Nie J.Y., Bengio Y., Modeling Term Dependencies with Quantum Language Models for IR, In: Proceedings of the 36Th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, SIGIR, 13, pp. 653-662, (2013); Widdows D., Peters S., Word vectors and quantum logic, Proceedings of the Eighth Mathematics of Language Conference, (2003); Clark S., Pulman S., Combining symbolic and distributional models of meaning, AAAI Spring Symposium: Quantum Interaction, pp. 52-55, (2007); Coecke B., Sadrzadeh M., Clark S., Mathematical foundations for a compositional distributional model of meaning., (2010); Coyle B., Mills D., Danos V., Kashefi E., The Born supremacy: quantum advantage and training of an Ising Born machine, npj Quant Inf, 6, 1, pp. 1-11, (2020); Yu Z., Chen Q., Jiao Y., Li Y., Lu X., Wang X., Yang J.Z., Provable Advantage of Parameterized Quantum Circuit in Function Approximation, (2023); Bowles J., Ahmed S., Schuld M., Better than classical?

Decision-making and resource management improve with convergence, enabling new agricultural solutions. This technique solves traditional computing's problems with large datasets and complex language processing, making it crucial for real-time decision-making. Problems include complex quantum algorithms, NLP models in quantum frameworks, and quantum hardware. This study presents Smart Agriculture Computing based on Quantum Natural Language Processing (SAC-QNLP) to overcome the aforesaid challenges. Agricultural data systems use quantum computing, data flow, and quantum-enhanced NLP algorithms. Quantum computing assesses large, complicated datasets faster than standard methods. Thus, smart agricultural strategy apps learn more and forecast better. Increased production projections from genetic and environmental factors SAC-QNLP could change farming. A simulation evaluated SAC-QNLP's performance and scalability. Older methods use more resources, produce less precise data, and are less efficient. The results show SAC-QNLP could boost farming production and sustainability.  © 2024 IEEE.",advanced agricultural solutions; natural language processing; production projection; quantum computing; smart agriculture computing,Quantum electronics; Advanced agricultural solution; Decision making managements; Decision resource management; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Production projection; Quantum Computing; Smart agriculture computing; Smart agricultures; Large datasets,,,,,,,"Zhang P., Guo Z., Ullah S., Melagraki G., Afantitis A., Lynch I., Nanotechnology and artificial intelligence to enable sustainable and precision agriculture, Nature Plants, 7, 7, pp. 864-876, (2021); Fountas S., Espejo-Garcia B., Kasimati A., Gemtou M., Panoutsopoulos H., Anastasiou E., Agriculture 5. 0: Cuttingedge technologies, trends, and challenges, IT Professional, 26, 1, pp. 40-47, (2024); Vardhan G.H., Sushanth K., The Future of Entrepreneurship: Employing Artificial Intelligence, Utilizing AI and Smart Technology to Improve Sustainability in Entrepreneurship, pp. 134-151, (2024); Alharbi M., Rajagopal S.K., Rajendran S., Alshahrani M., Plant disease classification based on ConvLSTM U-net with fully connected convolutional layers, Traitement du Signal, 40, 1, (2023); Rahman S.M., Alkhalaf O.H., Alam M.S., Tiwari S.P., Shafiullah M., Al-Judaibi S.M., Al-Ismail F.S., Climate Change Through Quantum Lens: Computing and Machine Learning, Earth Systems and Environment, pp. 1-18, (2024); Mousa N., Shirazi F., A survey analysis of quantum computing adoption and the paradigm of privacy engineering, Security and Privacy, (2024); Raveena S., Surendran R., Sustainable fertilizers in coffee plantation: Hybrid Recommendation for agricultural producers, 2023 5th International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications (ICIRCA), pp. 1664-1671, (2023); Selvanarayanan R., Rajendran S., Algburi S., Ibrahim Khalaf O., Hamam H., Empowering coffee farming using counterfactual recommendation based RNN driven IoT integrated soil quality command system, Scientific Reports, 14, 1, (2024); Redhu N.S., Thakur Z., Yashveer S., Mor P., Artificial intelligence: A way forward for agricultural sciences, Bioinformatics in Agriculture, pp. 641-668, (2022); Alazzai W.K., Obaid M.K., Abood B.S.Z., Jasim L., Smart Agriculture Solutions: Harnessing AI and IoT for Crop Management, E3S Web of Conferences, 477, (2024); Gyamfi E.K., ElSayed Z., Kropczynski J., Yakubu M.A., Elsayed N., Agricultural 4. 0 Leveraging on Technological Solutions: Study for Smart Farming Sector, (2024); Veeramanju K.T., Revolutionizing agriculture: A case study of IBM's AI innovations, International Journal of Applied Engineering and Management Letters (IJAEML), 7, 4, pp. 95-114, (2023); Dadi P.S., Tamilvizhi T., Surendran R., Layout optimization for agriculture or small scale agrarian industry, 2022 6th International Conference on Trends in Electronics and Informatics (ICOEI), pp. 174-179, (2022); Selvanarayanan R., Rajendran S., Alotaibi Y., Early Detection of Colletotrichum Kahawae Disease in Coffee Cherry Based on Computer Vision Techniques, CMES-Computer Modeling in Engineering & Sciences, 139, 1, (2024); Saravanan S.K., Nisha F., Rohit V.R., Lenin J., Selvam P.D., Rajmohan M., Impact of Cloud Computing on Agricultural Advancement using Data Mining Algorithms, 2023 2nd International Conference on Automation, Computing and Renewable Systems (ICACRS), pp. 1570-1575, (2023); Krishnan R.S., Raj J.R.F., Christopher V.B., Nandini N., Muthu A.E., Puvanadevi C., Enhancing Agricultural IoT with Predictive Analytics and Reinforcement Learning Models, 2024 International Conference on Integrated Circuits and Communication Systems (ICICACS), pp. 1-6, (2024); Deepa R., Jayalakshmi V., Thilakavathy P., Prabhu A.B., Surendran R., Quantum Machine Learning Techniques based on Nurturing Agri-Ontology Framework in Agricultural Science, 2024 3rd International Conference on Applied Artificial Intelligence and Computing (ICAAIC), pp. 413-420, (2024); Anbuselvan N., Manju A., Anandan P., IoT and Cloud-Based Smart Farming with Optimized Convolutional Neural Networks for Grape Fruit Disease Classification, 2023 International Conference on Data Science, Agents & Artificial Intelligence (ICDSAAI), pp. 1-5, (2023)","G.

We demonstrate various approaches to topic classification. The first uses an explicit word-based approach, in which word-topic weights are implemented as fractional rotations of individual qubits, and a phrase is classified based on the accumulation of these weights onto a scoring qubit, using entangling quantum gates. This is compared with more scalable quantum encodings of word embedding vectors, which are used to compute kernel values in a quantum support vector machine: this approach achieved an average of 62% accuracy on classification tasks involving over 10000 words, which is the largest such quantum computing experiment to date. We describe a quantum probability approach to bigram modeling that can be applied to understand sequences of words and formal concepts, investigate a generative approximation to these distributions using a quantum circuit Born machine, and introduce an approach to ambiguity resolution in verb-noun composition using single-qubit rotations for simple nouns and 2-qubit entangling gates for simple verbs. The smaller systems presented have been run successfully on physical quantum computers, and the larger ones have been simulated. We show that statistically meaningful results can be obtained, but the quality of individual results varies much more using real datasets than using artificial language examples from previous quantum NLP research. Related NLP research is compared, partly with respect to contemporary challenges including informal language, fluency, and truthfulness. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",68T50; 81P68; QNLP; Quantum computing; Quantum natural language processing; Quantum NLP,,,,,,,,"Widdows D., A mathematical model for context and word-meaning, International and Interdisciplinary Conference on Modeling and Using Context, pp. 369-382, (2003); Dirac P., The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, 4th edition, 1958, reprinted, (1930); Orrell D., Quantum Economics and Finance: An Applied Mathematics Introduction, (2020); Busemeyer J.R., Bruza P.D., Quantum Models of Cognition and Decision, (2012); Schrodinger E., Discussion of probability relations between separated systems, In: Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, 31, pp. 555-563, (1935); Cooke H.P., Treddenick H., Aristotle: Categories, (1938); Piedeleu R., Kartsaklis D., Coecke B.M., Open system categorical quantum semantics in natural language processing (, (2015); Coecke B., de Felice G., Meichanetzidis K., Toumi A., Foundations for near-term quantum natural language processing (, (2020); Geron A., Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems., (2019); Nielsen M.A., Chuang I., Quantum Computation and Quantum Information.

However, challenges such as language complexity and data limitations persist in natural language processing (NLP). Quantum computing utilizes quantum mechanics to tackle complex language structures with limited data. By integrating quantum computing with LSTM, we can address the issues of linguistic complexity and data scarcity. In this paper, we present a Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) network that comprehends the semantics of textual data. Our simulations demonstrate superior capability of QLSTM in capturing textual semantics. © 2024 IEEE.",Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM); Textual Semantics; Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs),Natural language processing systems; Quantum communication; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Semantics; Long-term dependencies; Memory network; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum long short-term memory; Semantics understanding; Sequential data; Short term memory; Textual semantic; Variational quantum circuit; Quantum computers,,,,,"Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP; Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (NRF-2022R1A4A3033401); Ministry of Science and ICT, (IITP-2024-2021-0-02046); Kyung Hee University, (KHU-20233691)","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (NRF-2022R1A4A3033401), the MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program (IITP-2024-2021-0-02046) supervised by the IITP (Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation), and Kyung Hee University in 2023 (KHU-20233691).","Zaman F., Farooq A., Ullah M.A., Jung H., Shin H., Win M.Z., Quantum Machine Intelligence for 6g URLLC, IEEE Wireless Commun., 30, 2, pp. 22-30, (2023); Khalid U., Ulum M.S., Farooq A., Duong T.Q., Dobre O.A., Shin H., Quantum semantic communications for Metaverse: Principles and challenges, IEEE Wireless Commun., 30, 4, pp. 26-36, (2023); Rizvi S.M.A., Ulum M.S., Asif N., Shin H., Neural networks with variational quantum circuits, 2023 9th International Conference on Industrial Networks and Intelligent Systems, pp. 203-214, (2023); Ansere J.A., Gyamfi E., Sharma V., Shin H., Dobre O.A., Duong T.Q., Quantum Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Resource Allocation in Mobile Edge Computing-Based IoT Systems, IEEE Trans.

However, due to the complicated high-dimensional component-property relationship, tuning material properties by researchers’ experience is challenging, even when guided by physical or empirical rules. Here, we adopt quantum computing (QC) technology and machine learning models to provide a proof-of-concept application of QC in physical metallurgy. We propose a quantum support vector machine (QSVM) model to predict single-phase CCAs. We show that fine-tuned quantum kernels with entanglement deliver promising performance, with a maximum accuracy of 89.4%. The QSVM model is then used to identify 1,741 lightweight CCAs jointly with a new text-mining-based method. Meanwhile, we devise a controllable approach to study the effect of noise on model performance and find that the noise level needs to be minimized for high-performance QSVM models. This study provides a practical and general approach to designing CCAs based on quantum technologies. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Alloy design; language models; MAP 2: Benchmark; quantum computer; quantum machine learning,Computational linguistics; Learning systems; Quantum entanglement; Qubits; Support vector machines; Alloy designs; Designing complex; Language model; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; MAP 2: benchmark; Quanta computers; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Support vector machine models; Modeling languages,,,,,"International Business Machines Corporation, IBM","This work was supported in part through the NYU IT High Performance Computing resources, services, and staff expertise.

Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have recently gained much attention due to their ability to generate diverse and high-quality samples in many computer vision tasks, as well as to incorporate flexible model architectures and a relatively simple training scheme. Quantum generative models, empowered by entanglement and superposition, have brought new insight to learning classical and quantum data. Inspired by the classical counterpart, we propose the quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic model (QuDDPM) to enable efficiently trainable generative learning of quantum data. QuDDPM adopts sufficient layers of circuits to guarantee expressivity, while it introduces multiple intermediate training tasks as interpolation between the target distribution and noise to avoid barren plateau and guarantee efficient training. We provide bounds on the learning error and demonstrate QuDDPM's capability in learning correlated quantum noise model, quantum many-body phases, and topological structure of quantum data. The results provide a paradigm for versatile and efficient quantum generative learning.  © 2024 American Physical Society.",,Computer vision; Learning systems; Quantum efficiency; Quantum entanglement; Quantum noise; Topology; De-noising; Enabling technologies; Generative model; High quality; Language model; Machine-learning; Probabilistic models; Quantum data; Quantum machines; Text generations; article; computer vision; controlled study; diffusion; generative model; human; large language model; learning; machine learning; noise; respiratory gas humidifier; Diffusion,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (ONR N00014-23-1-2296, CCF-2240641, DMS-2347760)",Q.\u2009Z. and B.\u2009Z. acknowledge support from NSF CAREER Awards No. CCF-2240641 and No. ONR N00014-23-1-2296.

That stated, there are problems with the consistency and fictitiousness of the evaluations because there are numerous fake or fraudulent ones. These misleading assessments are generated during the investigation in an attempt to mislead customers about the nature of a real advantage, compromising their ability to make a predetermined decision and damaging the reputations of businesses. A cutting-edge interrogation department revealed that quantum machine learning (QML) could manage a huge amount of machine-trained data and could convey almost emotional choices in the context of inaccurate checks. It is truly beneficial in obtaining reviews for things that are incorrect. Opinion, generating trends, interpersonal relationships, and assessing fatigue is merely a few of the attributes. Tests conducted utilizing the Amazon fraudulent review. The dataset demonstrates that QML tactics outperform conventional knowledge acquisition procedures in errands, including the place of fraudulent reviews. The delicacy and tolerance of incorrect review distinguishing evidence can be significantly advanced, although QML is still in its early stages of development. Both our proposed model and model pass rigorous conventional machine learning algorithms testing with a remarkable level of accuracy. An article introduces a unique approach to fraudulent review detection and brings in the QNN algorithm as a solution. A deep learning model, such as this one, has an 86% accuracy rate in quantum computer implementation, which is an impressive level of innovation, especially if it comes with successful results. Involvement in these cutting-edge technologies promises significant benefits in battling the problem of false identities on the Web. In our case, the experimental results demonstrate that our QNN algorithm, which can accurately identify fake reviews, will become a key weapon for suppressing various forms of fraudulence on emerging digital technology platforms. © The Author(s) 2024.",Convolution neural networks (CNN); E-commerce; Fake reviews; Fraud detection; Quantum machine learning (QML); Quantum neural networks (QNN); Sentiment analysis; User behaviour,,,,,,,,"Chen A., Lu Y., Wang B., Customers’ purchase decision-making process in social commerce: a social learning perspective, Int J Inf Manag, 37, 6, pp. 627-638, (2017); Wu Y., Et al., Fake online reviews: literature review, synthesis, and directions for future research, Decis Support Syst, 132, (2020); Alchieri L., Et al., An introduction to quantum machine learning: from quantum logic to quantum deep learning, Quantum Mach Intell, 3, pp. 1-30, (2021); Khakhar J., Data Graphics and Interactive Information Environments, (2008); Grant M.J., Booth A., A typology of reviews: an analysis of 14 review types and associated methodologies, Health Inform Libr J, 26, 2, pp. 91-108, (2009); Qu Z., Et al., QMFND: a quantum multimodal fusion-based fake news detection model for social media, Inform Fusion, 104, (2024); Zeguendry A., Jarir Z., Quafafou M., Quantum machine learning: a review and case studies, Entropy, 25, 2, (2023); Singamaneni K., Kumar A.K., Budati (2024) and Thulasi Bikku.

In this paper, we show an application of quantum models as probability calibrators to language models in Question and Answering (Q &A) tests. Our experiments show comparable results relative to the baseline Q &A models on all metrics. Here, we show another application of this class of models as confidence calibrators, where the parametrized quantum circuit receives a set of features coming from the language model and has to output a corrected confidence measure. The idea is to have a quantum model tell us when the language model is generating good answers or not. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Natural language processing; Quantum machine learning; Question Answering,Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Language model; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum models; Quantum neural networks; Question Answering; Computational linguistics,,,,,"National Institute of Science and Technology for Quantum Information, (2013/07375-0, 2014/12236-1, 2019/07665-4, 2019/18287-0, 308529/2021-9, INCT-IQ 465469/2014-0); Office of Naval Research, ONR, (N62909-24-1-2012); Office of Naval Research, ONR; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2021/04655-8, 2021/12407-4, 2023/04987-6); Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (303854/2022-7); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","RCG acknowledges support from National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), project number 303854/2022-7, and also from Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP), project number 2021/12407-4.

Nonetheless, the potential of natural language processing in the quantum paradigm (QNLP) is yet to be explored, including for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) machines. To explore the QNLP frontier, we introduce LEXIQL, a novel noise-aware QNLP technique for text classification on NISQ quantum machines. LEXIQL employs an incremental data injection approach to process textual data in a quantum circuit. It also develops new and effective training methods, such as leveraging a diverse mix of expressible and shallow quantum circuits for the QNLP task of text classification. Our extensive evaluation using Yelp, IMDB, and Amazon datasets (along with synthetic QLNP datasets) demonstrates the effectiveness of LEXIQL's noise-aware design in both ideal and noisy environments. © 2024 IEEE.",Natural Language Processing; Quantum Computing; Quantum Machine Learning,Adversarial machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Quantum electronics; Incremental data; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Text classification; Quantum computers,,,,,"Rice University; Northeastern University, NU; National Science Foundation, NSF, (2144540, 2124897, 1910601); National Science Foundation, NSF; Office of Science, SC, (DE-AC05-00OR22725); Office of Science, SC","We thank the reviewers for their constructive feedback.

In the classification task, we utilized an amplitude encoding algorithm and achieved perfect accuracy on the lambeq dataset discussed in literature. We obtained accuracy from 55% to 72.5% on the more complex and realistic Amazon review dataset. This is a reasonable result given the current state-of-the-art results in QNLP. Additionally, when using vector dimension reduction for embeddings, we found that UMAP leads to the best results in our experiment setting. All classification results were done on the default. qubit simulator in pennylane 0. 36 python library. Our classification results highlight the potential of quantum algorithms in practical applications. In the disambiguation task, we selected 18 ambiguous nouns, 32 unambiguous nouns, and 18 different verbs. Our experiments using the QASM simulator within the qiskit Python library demonstrated that the simulator could perfectly differentiate between the various meanings of ambiguous nouns in different contexts. Furthermore, we extended our study to a real quantum device, the ibm-kyoto quantum computer. There, we tested our disambiguation approach on a subset of 4 random nouns (2 ambiguous and 2 unambiguous) and observed that ibm-kyoto could achieve an accuracy range of 82.1% to 98.9% in disambiguation tasks, extending the datasets and improving the results of existing ambiguity resolution experiments [1].

Using Lambeq, an open-source library for quantum NLP, we focus on sentiment classification tasks to evaluate the impact of noisy quantum models. Our study involves the application of three types of optimizers: Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), Nelder-Mead, and Adam. The performance and resilience of these optimizers are assessed under various noise conditions to determine their effectiveness in maintaining model accuracy and stability. The research shows that the Adam optimizer outperforms SPSA and NelderMead in QNLP simple sentiment analysis tasks, both in noiseless and noisy environments. Adam achieved 96.67 % accuracy in noiseless conditions, significantly higher than SPSA's 83.33 % and Nelder-Mead's 53.33%, highlighting its superior performance in optimizing quantum circuits. Moreover, in noisy simulation, Adam outperforms others with 70.00% accuracy performance. The work is useful for NLP implementations in quantum computers. This research is essential because the noisy nature of current quan-tum computers makes it difficult for QNLP models to perform accurately and reliably.  © 2024 IEEE.",noisy quantum; Quantum Natural Language Processing; robustness; sentiment classification,Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Quantum electronics; Quantum noise; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Language processing; Natural languages; Nelder meads; Noisy quantum; Optimizers; Performance; Processing model; Quantum natural language processing; Robustness; Sentiment classification; Quantum computers,,,,,PPMI,This research is made possible through the support of the PPMI - Young Researcher Grant 2024 from STEI ITB.,"Biamonte J., Et al., Quantum Machine Learning, Nature, 549, 7671, pp. 195-202, (2018); Shor P.W., Scheme for reducing decoherence in quantum computer memory, Physical Review A, 52, 4, (1995); Kandala A., Et al., Error mitigation extends the computational reach of a noisy quantum processor, Nature, 567, 7749, pp. 491-495, (2019); Kartsaklis D., Et al., Lambeq: An efficient high-level Python library for quantum NLP, (2021); Lorenz R., Pearson A., Meichanetzidis K., Kartsaklis D., Coecke B., QNLP in Practice: Running Compositional Models of Meaning on a Quantum Computer, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 76, pp. 1305-1342, (2023); Guarasci R., De Pietro G., Esposito M., Quantum Natural Language Processing: Challenges and Opportunities, Applied Sciences, 12, 11, (2022); Vovrosh J., Khosla K.E., Greenaway S., Self C., Kim M., Knolle J., Simple Mitigation of Global Depolarizing Errors in Quantum Simulations, Phys.

The metrics we focus on are latency (i.e., the execution time), cost (i.e., a value of how expensive the query is in total), and cardinality (i.e., the number of rows in the result table). The critical link between QNLP and the database problem lies in using grammars, such as context-free grammar. Both natural language and SQL queries admit grammatical presentations, which allow us to develop a comprehensive framework for applying QNLP methods to solve the query estimation problem. The model comprises an encoding mechanism and a training phase, integrating classical and quantum subroutines. The encoding mechanism transforms SQL queries into parametrized quantum circuits as in QNLP. Classical optimization algorithms optimize the circuit parameters during training to predict query metrics. Comparing our model to the QNLP models, our model achieves accuracy comparable to the QNLP model in binary classification tasks. Additionally, we expand upon previous research by implementing multi-class classification tasks and comparing the cardinality estimation results to those of state-of-the-art databases. Our theoretical analysis of the quantum machine learning model includes calculations of its expressibility and entangling capabilities. The analysis reveals that the model possesses beneficial properties, making it suitable to be executed on near-term quantum hardware. © 2024 IEEE.",grammars; quantum machine learning; quantum natural language processing; relational databases; SQL,Context free grammars; Context sensitive grammars; Formal languages; Natural language processing systems; Problem oriented languages; Quantum electronics; Query languages; Relational database systems; Structured Query Language; Grammar; Language processing; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum natural language processing; Relational Database; SQL query; Subroutines,,,,,,,"Lan H., Bao Z., Peng Y., A survey on advancing the DBMS query optimizer: Cardinality estimation, cost model, and plan enumeration, Data Science and Engineering, 6, 1, pp. 86-101, (2021); Schonberger M., Applicability of quantum computing on database query optimization, Proceedings of the 2022 International Conference on Management of Data., pp. 2512-2514, (2022); Uotila V., Synergy between quantum computers and databases, Proceedings of the VLDB 2022 PhD Workshop co-located with the 48th International Conference on Very Large Databases (VLDB 2022), 3186, (2022); Trummer I., Koch C., Multiple query optimization on the d-wave 2x adiabatic quantum computer, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 9, 9, pp. 648-659, (2016); Schonberger M., Scherzinger S., Mauerer W., Ready to leap (by co-design). join order optimisation on quantum hardware, Proc.

An emergent application of Quantum Machine Intelligence (QMI) is Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP). This paper proposes a multi-dimensional, finite automaton model for quantum word embedding (QWE) via the Galois field. We demonstrated the model to three applications: (1) English vocabulary, (2) amino acid-based genetic codes, and (3) DNA-based genetic codes. The numerical results obtained from the proposed algorithm for the English vocabulary indicate that it produces more representative word features than Word2Vec based on the word distance metric. Second, the proposed algorithm is also utilized to model RNA-Protein interaction based on the latent distance of a given molecule, which is demonstrated on three large datasets, namely RPI369, RPI1807, and RPI2241. Finally, two embedding techniques for DNA-based genetic codes are proposed in this work: Two-state Lackadaisical Encoding (TCE) and Topological-Cyclic Encoding (TLE). These techniques enable extracting relevant features for the efficacy score of gRNAs used in the CRISPR-Cas 9 system, demonstrated on 15 datasets, compared to 12 mathematical features.

One emerging subarea in quantum machine learning is quantum natural language processing, which combines quantum computing advantages and speedups with language processing algorithms to create and perform natural language tasks such as text classification or generation. The libraries and toolboxes used in this subarea include DisCoPy and lambeq, which are used to transform sentences into string diagrams or monoidal functors, convert these diagrams into quantum circuits or ansatz and embed it into a quantum model. In this study, we used both libraries with different text-based datasets to perform sentiment analysis via classification. To do so, we create synthetic datasets to train the different models. After we obtain satisfactory results, we test the resulting models with known datasets. Despite its promising results, quantum natural language processing is far from achieving its full potential. To achieve this potential, the quantum software and hardware must be improved to make them suitable for use with more extensive and complex datasets and other tasks. © 2024 The Author(s)",Quantum computing;

These studies often apply natural language processing (NLP) technologies due to the natural similarity between code and language. Since NLP usually consumes a lot of computing resources, its combination with quantum computing is becoming a valuable research direction. In this paper, we present a Recurrent Quantum Embedding Neural Network (RQENN) for vulnerability detection. It aims to reduce the memory consumption of classical models for vulnerability detection tasks and improve the performance of quantum natural language processing (QNLP) methods. We show that the performance of RQENN achieves the above goals. Compared with the classic model, the space complexity of each stage of its execution is exponentially reduced, and the number of parameters used and the number of bits consumed are significantly reduced. Compared with other QNLP methods, RQENN uses fewer qubit resources and achieves a 15.7% higher accuracy in vulnerability detection. © The Author(s) 2024.",,quantum dot; article; deep learning; diagnosis; female; human; natural language processing; nerve cell network; vulnerability,,,,,"Major Science and Technology Projects in Anhui Province, (221100210600); Major Science and Technology Projects in Anhui Province","This study was funded by Major Science and Technology Projects in Henan Province, China (Grant No. 221100210600).

These characteristics make it particularly difficult for large models to effectively handle long Chinese texts using traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms. This paper explores the application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) as a solution to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in processing long Chinese texts. By leveraging the inherent advantages of QML, such as higher processing efficiency and deeper semantic understanding, this research demonstrates through experimental comparisons that QML models significantly outperform traditional ML models in both speed and comprehension accuracy. The paper systematically introduces text processing methods using both traditional ML and QML, and presents a simplified QML model designed to enhance text processing capabilities.

Although some efforts based on syntactic analysis have opened the door to research in quantum NLP (QNLP), limitations such as heavy syntactic preprocessing and syntax-dependent network architecture make them impracticable on larger and real-world data sets. In this paper, we propose a new simple network architecture, called the quantum self-attention neural network (QSANN), which can compensate for these limitations. Specifically, we introduce the self-attention mechanism into quantum neural networks and then utilize a Gaussian projected quantum self-attention serving as a sensible quantum version of self-attention. As a result, QSANN is effective and scalable on larger data sets and has the desirable property of being implementable on near-term quantum devices. In particular, our QSANN outperforms the best existing QNLP model based on syntactic analysis as well as a simple classical self-attention neural network in numerical experiments of text classification tasks on public data sets. We further show that our method exhibits robustness to low-level quantum noises and showcases resilience to quantum neural network architectures. © Science China Press 2024.",natural language processing; parameterized quantum circuits; quantum neural networks; self-attention; text classification,Classification (of information); Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Quantum computers; Quantum noise; Syntactics; Text processing; Timing circuits; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Neural-networks; Parameterized; Parameterized quantum circuit; Quantum circuit; Quantum neural networks; Self-attention; Text classification; Network architecture,,,,,"Chongqing University of Science and Technology, CQUST; Bureau of Education of Guangzhou Municipality; Quantum Science Center of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area; Chenghong ZHU; Guangdong Provincial Quantum Science Strategic Initiative, (GDZX2303007); Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0302901); China Scholarship Council, CSC, (201806070139); China Scholarship Council, CSC; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP180100691, G0101000151); Australian Research Council, ARC","This work was partially supported by Guangdong Provincial Quantum Science Strategic Initiative (Grant No. GDZX2303007).

This paper considers the problem of automatically transforming existing neural networks into corresponding variational quantum circuits. In particular, given a trained neural network, the paper considers estimating the number of ansatz layers so that the corresponding circuit is not over or under-parametrized. This is achieved by constructing a dataset containing many trained neural networks each labelled with the corresponding optimal number of variational quantum layers, obtained through experimentation. The paper further performs dataset augmentation using an LLM model to speed up dataset construction. The paper then selects a set of features based on both the network architecture and the trained parameters, and then trains a feed-forward neural network. The trained network achieves 86.7% accuracy on unseen unaugmented test circuits. © 2024 IEEE.",Neural Networks; quantum machine learning; Quantum neural networks; Variational quantum classifier (VQC),Adversarial machine learning; Image segmentation; Machine learning; Multilayer neural networks; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Variational techniques; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Parametrizations; Quanta computers; Quantum circuit; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum neural networks; Trained neural networks; Variational quantum classifier; Quantum computers,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (JPJSBP 120226002); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS; Science and Technology Development Fund, STDF, (46263); Science and Technology Development Fund, STDF","This work was supported by JSPS Bilateral Program Number JPJSBP 120226002.

Guided by grammatical structure, words compose with each other to form sentences. Similarly, guided by discourse structure, sentences compose with each other to form dialogues and documents. Classical machine learning algorithms have achieved significant success in learning the meanings of words. When it comes to meanings of sentences and discourse units, they however fall short of being compositional. The DisCoCat model of meaning, introduced by Clark, Coecke, and Sadrzadeh in 2010, provides a solution—at the sentence level—using higher-order tensors, the learning of which has been a challenge. A recent initiative known as Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) introduces a translation between the DisCoCat tensors and Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC). This offers the potential of learning these higher-order tensors more efficiently when the circuits are executed on quantum computers. In previous work, we lifted the DisCoCat framework from the sentence level to the discourse level using a Fock space semantics. In this paper, we extend the DisCoCat-VQC translation to this semantics and experiment with it in a discourse task. We develop a massive dataset with 16,400 entries inspired by a major coreference resolution task, known as the Winograd Schema Challenge, proposed as a test of machine intelligence. Noisy and noiseless simulations were executed on IBMQ software, and the parameters of the discourse VQCs were learnt. The model converged to 77.5% accuracy, surpassing a Bag-of-Words model that neglects any structure. It also outperformed 2 out of 3 state-of-the-art classical coreference resolution architectures. These findings highlight the significant potential of quantum machine learning in advancing discourse analysis and structured natural language processing. © The Author(s) 2024.",Categorial grammars; Coreference resolution; Diagrammatic calculi; Fock spaces; Hybrid quantum-classical methods; Modal Lambek calculus; Quantum machine learning; Quantum natural language processing; Tensor space semantics; Variational quantum circuits,Context sensitive grammars; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Quantum electronics; Tensors; Variational techniques; Categorial grammar; Coreference resolution; Diagrammatic calculus; Fock spaces; Hybrid quantum-classical method; Lambek calculus; Language processing; Machine-learning; Modal lambek calculus; Natural languages; Quantum circuit; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum natural language processing; Quantum-classical methods; Space semantics; Tensor space semantic; Tensor spaces; Variational quantum circuit; Semantics,,,,,"UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (106170); Royal Academy of Engineering, RAENG, (RCSRF2122-14-152); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/S021582/1)","Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh would like to express gratitude for the Royal Academy of Engineering Research Chair/Senior Research Fellowship RCSRF2122-14-152 on Engineered Mathematics for Modelling Typed Structures, which provided valuable funding for this research.

However, implementing such complex tasks with LLMs poses a significant challenge, as classical computers may lack the necessary space to run or store the model parameters. In this context leveraging the principles of hybrid quantum machine learning for language models offers a promising solution to mitigate this issue by reducing storage space for model parameters. Although pure quantum language models have demonstrated success in recent past, they are constrained by limited features and availability. In this research we propose the DeepKet model an approach with a quantum embedding layer, which utilizes the Hilbert space generated by quantum entanglement to store feature vectors, leading to a significant reduction in size. The experimental analysis evaluates the performance of open-source pre-trained models like Microsoft Phi and CodeGen, specifically fine-tuned for generating Prolog code for geo-spatial data retrieval. Furthermore, it investigates the effectiveness of quantum DeepKet embedding layers by comparing them with the total parameter count of traditional models. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Generative AI; Large language model; Prolog; Quantum computing; Quantum machine learning; Transfer learning; Word2Vec,C (programming language); Embeddings; PROLOG (programming language); Quantum optics; Query languages; Structured Query Language; Transfer learning; Generative AI; Language model; Large language model; Machine-learning; Prolog; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Transfer learning; Word2vec; Quantum entanglement,,,,,,,"Vaswani A., Shazeer N., Parmar N., Uszkoreit J., Jones L., Gomez A.N.L.I.:., Attention is all you need, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 30, (2017); Kim K., Ghatpande S., Kim D., Zhou X., Liu K., Bissyande T.F., Klein J., Le Traon Y., Big code search: a bibliography, ACM Comput.

Variational quantum algorithms, especially those employing variational quantum circuits, have demonstrated notable advantages in domains including finance, chemistry, and machine learning. However, the practical deployment of these algorithms on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices faces challenges due to quantum noise, state collapse, and limited qubits numbers. The real-world performance of these algorithms remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing and implementing a novel method for training quantum self-attention model for text classification directly on quantum computing chips. This initiative marks the first instance of employing such models on actual quantum hardware. Our approach optimizes quantum circuit designs to mitigate the impact of quantum noise and introduces parallel training strategies to enhance efficiency. Our experiments, conducted on the 'Wukong' superconducting 72-qubit quantum computer, demonstrate that our models can be effectively trained on real quantum hardware. The results from the actual quantum chips slightly outperformed those from simulators, confirming the practical feasibility of applying quantum self-attention model to natural language processing tasks. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and provide valuable insights for the future deployment of quantum machine learning models.  © 2024 IEEE.",near-term quantum computer; quantum computing; quantum machine learning,Adversarial machine learning; Computer circuits; Integrated circuit design; Machine learning; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Quantum efficiency; Quantum electronics; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Variational techniques; Attention model; Computing paradigm; Development potential; Machine-learning; Near-term quantum computer; Quanta computers; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Qubits,,,,,,,"Preskill J., Quantum computing 40 years later, Feynman Lectures on Computation, pp. 193-244, (2023); Egger D.J., Gambella C., Marecek J., McFaddin S., Mevissen M., Raymond R., Simonetto A., Woerner S., Yndurain E., Quantum computing for finance: State of the art and future prospects, IEEE Transactions on Quantum Engineering, 1, (2020); McArdle S., Endo S., Aspuru-Guzik A., Benjamin S.C., Yuan X., Quantum computational chemistry, Reviews of Modern Physics, 92, 1, (2020); Guerreschi G.G., Smelyanskiy V., Babbush R., McClean J., Optimization algorithms for quantum processors, Quantum Science and Technology, 8, 1, (2023); Schuld M., Petruccione F., Machine learning with quantum computers, Nature Reviews Physics, 4, 5, pp. 310-324, (2022); Huang H.-Y., Broughton M., Mohseni M., Babbush R., Boixo S., Neven H., McClean J.R., Power of data in quantum machine learning, Nature Communications, 12, 1, (2021); Preskill J., Quantum computing in the nisq era and beyond, Quantum, 2, (2018); Gambetta J., Chow J.M., Steffen M., Building logical qubits in a superconducting quantum computing system, npj Quantum Information, 3, 1, pp. 1-7, (2021); Bluvstein D., Demler E., Lukin M.D., A blueprint for demonstrating quantum supremacy with superconducting qubits, Science, 375, 6578, pp. 745-750, (2022); Cerezo M., Arrasmith A., Babbush R., Benjamin S.C., Endo S., Fujii K., McClean J.R., Mitarai K., Yuan X., Cincio L., Et al., Variational quantum algorithms, Nature Reviews Physics, 3, 9, pp. 625-644, (2021); Gentinetta G., Metz F., Carleo G., Overhead-constrained circuit knitting for variational quantum dynamics, Quantum, 8, (2024); McClean J.R., Romero J., Babbush R., Aspuru-Guzik A., The theory of variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, New Journal of Physics, 18, 2, (2016); Hidary J.D., Hidary J.D., Quantum computing: An applied approach, 1, (2019); LaRose R., Tikku A., O'Neel-Judy E., Cincio L., Coles P.J., Robust data encodings for quantum classifiers, Quantum Machine Intelligence, 2, 1, pp. 1-8, (2020); Schuld M., Sinayskiy I., Petruccione F., An introduction to quantum machine learning, Contemporary Physics, 56, 2, pp. 172-185, (2015); Nocedal J., Wright S.J., Numerical Optimization, Springer Science & Business Media, (2006); Vaswani A., Shazeer N., Parmar N., Uszkoreit J., Jones L., Gomez A.N., Kaiser L., Polosukhin I., Attention is all you need, Advances in neural information processing systems, 30, (2017); Lin Z., Feng M., Santos C.N.D., Yu M., Xiang B., Zhou B., Bengio Y., A structured self-attentive sentence embedding, (2017); Li G., Zhao X., Wang X., Quantum self-attention neural networks for text classification, Science China Information Sciences, 67, 4, (2024); Schuld M., Bergholm V., Gogolin C., Izaac J., Killoran N., Evaluating analytic gradients on quantum hardware, Physical Review A, 99, 3, (2019); Stokes J., Izaac J., Killoran N., Carleo G., Quantum natural gradient, Quantum, 4, (2020); Lorenz R., Pearson A., Meichanetzidis K., Kartsaklis D., Coecke B., Qnlp in practice: Running compositional models of meaning on a quantum computer, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 76, pp. 1305-1342, (2023)",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,IEEE Communications Society; University of Science and Technology of China,"16th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing, WCSP 2024",24 October 2024 through 26 October 2024,Hefei,206065.0,,979-835039064-3,,,English,"Int.

Variational quantum circuits, where parameters of circuits are learned classically, have been widely used in many recent applications of QML. This is an instance of a hybrid quantum-classical framework, where both classical and quantum components are present. However, applying these techniques to applications involving massive data is a challenging task. One way to overcome this, is using the concept of classical-quantum transfer learning with the help of a dressed quantum circuit, introduced recently, where the underlying neural architecture is pre-trained classically, but at the final steps (decision layer), a quantum circuit is used, followed by quantum measurements and post-processing to classify images with high precision. In this paper, we applied hybrid classical-quantum transfer learning to another task of massive data processing, i.e., natural language processing (NLP). We show how to (binary) classify short texts (e.g., SMS) with classical-quantum transfer learning, which was originally applied to image processing only. Our quantum network uses pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers (BERT) model, and its variational quantum circuit is fine-tuned for text processing. We evaluated the performance of our hybrid neural architecture using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which is typically used in the evaluation of classification problems. The results indicate high precision as well as lower loss function. To our knowledge, our work is the first application of quantum transfer learning to the area of NLP.

Thus, the detection of ADRs is crucial. This paper introduces a classical-quantum hybrid deep learning model for detecting adverse drug effects from social media reviews (in English). The suggested methodology improvises the ability to grasp human language for identifying pharmacological side effects of a drug. This article aims to combine the features of traditional machine learning methods to quantum computing into a single framework. The knowledge gained from the pre-trained classical model is transferred to quantum model, improving the performance of quantum algorithms. The Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) encodes, classical data and classifies input reviews into feature vectors. It creates a relationship network for each drug, based on condition and review comments, enabling class wise prediction to detect ADRs in a drug. The accuracy of quantum inspired transfer learning based proposed model architecture is quite encouraging and provides a good enough solution. In identifying ADRs from the study of reviews, this work obtained accuracy of 97% with a training loss of 0.0659 and validation loss of 0.072. A Bio-BERT based quantum transfer hybrid methodology is proposed for detecting adverse drug reactions from social media reviews. It provides more accurate prediction on ADRs of drug rather than earlier introduced methodologies. The proposed methodology emphasizes towards the quantum enhanced hybrid model design in research. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs); Bio-BERT; Natural Language Processing (NLP); Quantum Transfer Learning (QTL); Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC),,,,,,,,"Huang J.-Y., Lee W.-P., Lee K.-D., Predicting adverse drug reactions from social media posts: Data balance, feature selection and deep learning, Healthcare, 10, (2022); Odeh F., Taweel A., A deep learning approach to extracting adverse drug reactions, 2019 IEEE/ACS 16Th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA), pp. 1-6, (2019); Fox S., Et al., The social life of health information, 2011, (2011); Bouvy J.C., De Bruin M.L., Koopmanschap M.A., Epidemiology of adverse drug reactions in Europe: A review of recent observational studies, Drug Safety, 38, 5, pp. 437-453, (2015); Proposal for a regulation amending, as regards pharmacovigilance of medicinal products for human use, Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004.

While machine learning and deep learning methods are widely used for stock closing price prediction, these methods have some drawbacks, including high scalability, slow convergence, and poor generalization performance. Furthermore, because those models are inherently black-box, it is challenging to comprehend the logic underlying their forecasts. This study presents an explainable hybrid quantum neural network to investigate the influence of tweets on a stock price prediction. The datasets used in this analysis include the stock prices of six different organizations as well as the 4 million+ tweets written on X (previously Twitter). The proposed methodology finds the average sentiment score of daily tweets using a transformer model which is combined with historical stock data. The proposed hybrid genetic algorithm based quantum neural network predicts the future stock closing price more accurately and uses explainable artificial intelligence methods to investigate the influence of average sentiment score of tweets and compute each attribute contribution towards the outcome. The proposed hybrid quantum neural network outperforms the other existing classical machine learning and quantum inspired machine learning algorithms by achieving a model accuracy (R2) greater than 99% in the prediction of stock prices for the six different organizations. Further, based on the explainability analysis, we observe that the tweets do not influence stock price to a greater extent. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Explainable artificial intelligence; Genetic algorithm; Quantum neural networks; Sentiment analysis; Stock price prediction; Transformer model,Costs; Deep learning; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Sentiment analysis; Explainable artificial intelligence; Learning methods; Machine-learning; Price prediction; Quantum neural networks; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment scores; Stock price; Stock price prediction; Transformer modeling; Genetic algorithms,,,,,,,"Liu G., Ma W., A quantum artificial neural network for stock closing price prediction, Inform Sci, 598, pp. 75-85, (2022); Yildirim D.C., Toroslu I.H., Fiore U., Forecasting directional movement of forex data using LSTM with technical and macroeconomic indicators, Financ Innov, 7, pp. 1-36, (2021); Wu D., Ma X., Olson D.L., Financial distress prediction using integrated Z-score and multilayer perceptron neural networks, Decis Support Syst, 159, (2022); Liu W., Yang Z., Cao Y., Huo J., Discovering the influences of the patent innovations on the stock market, Inf Process Manage, 59, 3, (2022); Yuan F., Zhan H., Stock market investment behavior based on behavioral finance based on data fusion algorithm, IETE J Res, pp. 1-7, (2022); Xu H., Cao D., Li S., A self-regulated generative adversarial network for stock price movement prediction based on the historical price and tweets, Knowl-Based Syst, 247, (2022); Ni H., Wang S., Cheng P., A hybrid approach for stock trend prediction based on tweets embedding and historical prices, World Wide Web, 24, pp. 849-868, (2021); Chiong R., Fan Z., Hu Z., Dhakal S., A novel ensemble learning approach for stock market prediction based on sentiment analysis and the sliding window method, IEEE Trans Comput Soc Syst, (2022); Chaudhari K., Thakkar A., Data fusion with factored quantization for stock trend prediction using neural networks, Inf Process Manage, 60, 3, (2023); Yan X., Yang H., Yu Z., Zhang S., Zheng X., Portfolio optimization: A return-on-equity network analysis, IEEE Trans Comput Soc Syst, (2023); Ma Y., Han R., Wang W., Portfolio optimization with return prediction using deep learning and machine learning, Expert Syst Appl, 165, (2021); Liu J., Lim K.H., Wood K.L., Huang W., Guo C., Huang H.-L., Hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural networks, Sci China Phys Mech Astron, 64, 9, (2021); Adadi A., Berrada M., Peeking inside the black-box: a survey on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), IEEE access, 6, pp. 52138-52160, (2018); Omrani N., Rivieccio G., Fiore U., Schiavone F., Agreda S.G., To trust or not to trust?

Given that the transformer, with self-attention as its core mechanism, has become a popular backbone model in the field of machine learning, the exploration of a quantum version of the self-attention mechanism has become an intriguing topic. In this paper, we propose a Quantum Self-Attention Model (QSAM) based on Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA), aiming to combine the advantages of quantum neural network and self-attention together. To implement the self-attention mechanism on quantum neural network, we employ parameterized quantum circuits to learn the features of input data in quantum-enhanced spaces, then introduce the innovative Amplitude-Phase Decomposition Measurement (APDM) to obtain the essential components of self-attention model: query, key and value. By introducing APDM, we can implement the quantum self-attention model with a lower parameter quantity than that of previous methods, making our QSAM have a better deployability on near-term quantum devices. We apply QSAM on both NLP and CV datasets for binary and multiple classification. The results show that our QSAM outperforms its classical counterpart and is as good as the state-of-the-art quantum self-attention model on NLP datasets.

Traditional methods often grapple with the high-dimensional nature of textual data, leading to substantial computational demands. This study introduces a novel classical quantum k-nearest neighbors (CQKNN) algorithm, which integrates quantum circuits into a conventional machine-learning framework to enhance computational efficiency and reduce storage requirements. This hybrid approach uses a unified quantum circuit that simplifies multiple similarity calculations through mid-circuit measurements and qubit reset operations, significantly improving upon traditional multi-circuit quantum k-nearest neighbors (QKNN) models. The CQKNN algorithm, tested on datasets such as SMS Spam Collection, Twitter US Airline Sentiment, and IMDB Movie Reviews, not only outperforms classical KNN but also addresses challenges posed by noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices through advanced error mitigation techniques. This work highlights resource efficiency and reduced gate complexity and demonstrates the practical application of fidelity in quantum similarity calculations, setting new standards for quantum-enhanced machine learning and advancing current quantum technology capabilities in complex data classification tasks. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",hybrid classical quantum k-nearest neighbors; quantum computing; quantum machine learning; qubit reuse; text classification,Classification (of information); Computational efficiency; Digital storage; Learning algorithms; Motion compensation; Natural language processing systems; Nearest neighbor search; Quantum efficiency; Qubits; Text processing; Timing circuits; Classical-quantum; Hybrid classical quantum k-near neighbor; K Nearest Neighbor (k NN) algorithm; Machine-learning; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Qubit reuse; Reuse; Text classification; Machine learning,,,,,,,"Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum computation and quantum information, (2010); Wiebe N., Kapoor A., Svore K., (2014); Ruan Y., Xue X., Liu H., Tan J., Li X., Int.

Product reviews have become a cornerstone within this digital retail landscape, offering invaluable guidance to customers and business proprietors. Shoppers rely on reviews to make well-informed decisions, gaining insights into product quality and functionality, while entrepreneurs utilize this feedback to refine their offerings and elevate customer satisfaction. The analysis of sentiments embedded within product reviews presents formidable challenges due to the intricacies of human language and the sheer volume of data. To address this tough challenge, this paper introduces Resilient Grey Wolf Optimization-based Gaussian-Enhanced Quantum Deep Neural Networks (RGWO-GEQDNN). This novel approach amalgamates the robust, Resilient Grey Wolf Optimization with Gaussian-enhanced Quantum Deep Neural Networks, providing a potent solution for efficient and accurate sentiment analysis within product reviews. RGWO-GEQDNN emphasizes the innovative fusion of nature-inspired optimization and quantum computing principles, promising a breakthrough in sentiment analysis. To assess the performance of RGWO-GEQDNN against state-of-the-art algorithms, Amazon product review dataset is utilized. The results underscore the superiority of RGWO-GEQDNN in accurately classifying sentiment from product reviews, highlighting its transformative potential in the e-commerce landscape. © 2023 Little Lion Scientific.",Amazon; Classification; Neural Network; Online Shopping; Reviews; Sentiment,,,,,,,,"Rabeya T., Khatun E., Noori S.

Furthermore, researchers and engineers are quickly becoming interested in natural language processing (NLP) as a topic for developing more comprehensive computational models of NLP. Therefore, there is hope for future progress in NLP efforts that use quantum technology, especially in emotion classification. In this study, we use quantum computing models to delve deeply into two sentiment categorization approaches. To be more specific, the effectiveness of the models is evaluated by looking at VQC and QSVM. The analyzed models are evaluated by simulations in the Qiskit simulator and the real-time quantum computer Qiskit_ibm_osaka.

The field that has, to date, yielded more quantum-based attention is the retrieval and classification of textual data. This work aims to replicate the excellent results of hybrid quantum approaches for syntactic tasks on semantic classification tasks. In detail, a quantum machine learning algorithm, namely, the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), is used to perform sentiment analysis classification tasks. This algorithm can deduce the relationships between input features and their corresponding class affiliations using a parametrized quantum circuit and an encoding layer that translates classical data into quantum states. The approach has been tested on a well-known benchmark annotated dataset used for the Italian language, and the results have been compared to existing baselines, pointing out state-of-the-art scores. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",QNLP;

We focus on the recently proposed DisCoCirc framework for natural language, and propose a quantum adaptation, QDisCoCirc. This is motivated by a compositional approach to rendering AI interpretable: the behavior of the whole can be understood in terms of the behavior of parts, and the way they are put together. For the model-native primitive operation of text similarity, we derive quantum algorithms for fault-tolerant quantum computers to solve the task of question-answering within QDisCoCirc, and show that this is BQP-hard; note that we do not consider the complexity of question-answering in other natural language processing models. Assuming widely-held conjectures, implementing the proposed model classically would require super-polynomial resources. Therefore, it could provide a meaningful demonstration of the power of practical quantum processors. The model construction builds on previous work in compositional quantum natural language processing. Word embeddings are encoded as parameterized quantum circuits, and compositionality here means that the quantum circuits compose according to the linguistic structure of the text. We outline a method for evaluating the model on near-term quantum processors, and elsewhere we report on a recent implementation of this on quantum hardware. In addition, we adapt a quantum algorithm for the closest vector problem to obtain a Grover-like speedup in the fault-tolerant regime for our model. This provides an unconditional quadratic speedup over any classical algorithm in certain circumstances, which we will verify empirically in future work. © T. Laakkonen, K. Meichanetzidis, B.

The insufficiency of classic phishing detection tools has become apparent as fraudsters continue to develop new strategies; these approaches mostly depend on variables such as URL character sequences, site content, and visual resemblance. The present study highlights the ""Zérosdetect"" approach, a quantum-powered technique for detecting phishing URLs using zero-shot learning, a robust model that makes use of both the zero-shot learning's adaptability and the computational advantageous nature of quantum computing, it mitigates the need for extensive previous knowledge of phishing URL attributes. In order to detect previously undiscovered phishing attacks, quantum neural network have been deployed to convert URL data into quantum spaces, therefore using the computational benefits of quantum systems. Quantum layers embedded inside Qnodes are a key part of the present system, calculating gradients at a faster pace, optimizing the network performance by rapidly calculating gradients, making the solution both efficient and forward-thinking. The present study lays the groundwork for future cybersecurity initiatives in the era of quantum computing, enhancing the potential to predict new cases of phishing. © 2023 IEEE.",Cybersecurity frameworks; Natural Language Processing; Quantum Computing; Quantum Language Models; Zero-Shot Learning,Computer crime; Data handling; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Zero-shot learning; Confidential information; Cyber security; Cybersecurity framework; Language model; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Phishing; Quantum Computing; Quantum language model; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Vedral V., Introduction to Quantum Information Science, (2006); Horodecki R., Horodecki P., Horodecki M., Horodecki K., Quantum entanglement, Reviews of Modern Physics, 81, 2, pp. 865-942, (2009); Shor P.W., Algorithms for quantum computation: discrete logarithms and factoring, Proceedings 35th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science; Grover L.K., A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for database search, Proceedings of the twenty-eighth annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing - STOC'96, (1996); Biamonte J., Wittek P., Pancotti N., Rebentrost P., Wiebe N., Lloyd S., Quantum machine learning, Nature, 549, 7671, pp. 195-202, (2017); Schuld M., Sinayskiy I., Petruccione F., An introduction to quantum machine learning, Contemporary Physics, 56, 2, pp. 172-185, (2014); Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (2012); Chen Y., Pan Y., Dong D., Quantum Language Model With Entanglement Embedding for Question Answering, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 53, 6, pp. 3467-3478, (2023); Li Q., Uprety S., Wang B., Song D., Quantum-Inspired Complex Word Embedding, Proceedings of The Third Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP, (2018); Kumar Y., Verma S.K., Sharma S., Quantum-inspired binary gravitational search algorithm to recognize the facial expressions, International Journal of Modern Physics C, 31, 10, (2020); Lai W., Shi J., Chang Y., Quantum-Inspired Fully Complex-Valued Neutral Network for Sentiment Analysis, Axioms, 12, 3, (2023); Xian Y., Lampert C.H., Schiele B., Akata Z., Zero-Shot Learning-A Comprehensive Evaluation of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 41, 9, pp. 2251-2265, (2019); Somesha M., Pais A.R., Rao R.S., Rathour V.S., Efficient deep learning techniques for the detection of phishing websites, Sādhanā, 45, 1, (2020); Aljofey A., Et al., An effective detection approach for phishing websites using URL and HTML features, Scientific Reports, 12, 1, (2022); Sarhan M., Layeghy S., Gallagher M., Portmann M., From zero-shot machine learning to zero-day attack detection, International Journal of Information Security, 22, 4, pp. 947-959, (2023); Wang W., Zheng V.W., Yu H., Miao C., A Survey of Zero-Shot Learning, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 10, 2, pp. 1-37, (2019); Di Pierro A., Incudini M., Quantum Machine Learning and Fraud Detection, Protocols, Strands, and Logic, pp. 139-155, (2021); Aldakheel E.A., Zakariah M., Gashgari G.A., Almarshad F.A., Alzahrani A.I.A., A Deep Learning-Based Innovative Technique for Phishing Detection in Modern Security with Uniform Resource Locators, Sensors, 23, 9, (2023); Boneh D., Zhandry M., Quantum-Secure Message Authentication Codes, Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2013, pp. 592-608, (2013); Dunjko V., Taylor J.M., Briegel H.J., Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning, Physical Review Letters, 117, 13, (2016); Marchal S., Francois J., State R., Engel T., PhishStorm: Detecting Phishing With Streaming Analytics, IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, 11, 4, pp. 458-471, (2014)",,Mohan J.; Chaturvedi B.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"9th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication, ICSC 2023",21 December 2023 through 23 December 2023,Noida,197666.0,,979-835038320-1,,,English,"Int.

In recent years, both quantum computing and machine learning have shown great promise in the field of document classification. However, there is a lack of research investigating the performance of these techniques on the Arabic language. This paper presents a comparative study of quantum computing and machine learning for two datasets of Arabic language document classification. In the first dataset of 213,465 Arabic tweets, both classic machine learning (ML) and quantum computing approaches achieve high accuracy in sentiment analysis, with quantum computing slightly outperforming classic ML. Quantum computing completes the task in approximately 59 min, slightly faster than classic ML, which takes around 1 h. The precision, recall, and F1 score metrics indicate the effectiveness of both approaches in predicting sentiment in Arabic tweets. Classic ML achieves precision, recall, and F1 score values of 0.8215, 0.8175, and 0.8121, respectively, while quantum computing achieves values of 0.8239, 0.8199, and 0.8147, respectively. In the second dataset of 44,000 tweets, both classic ML (using the Random Forest algorithm) and quantum computing demonstrate significantly reduced processing times compared to the first dataset, with no substantial difference between them. Classic ML completes the analysis in approximately 2 min, while quantum computing takes approximately 1 min and 53 s. The accuracy of classic ML is higher at 0.9241 compared to 0.9205 for quantum computing. However, both approaches achieve high precision, recall, and F1 scores, indicating their effectiveness in accurately predicting sentiment in the dataset. Classic ML achieves precision, recall, and F1 score values of 0.9286, 0.9241, and 0.9249, respectively, while quantum computing achieves values of 0.92456, 0.9205, and 0.9214, respectively. The analysis of the metrics indicates that quantum computing approaches are effective in identifying positive instances and capturing relevant sentiment information in large datasets. On the other hand, traditional machine learning techniques exhibit faster processing times when dealing with smaller dataset sizes. This study provides valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of quantum computing and machine learning for Arabic document classification, emphasizing the potential of quantum computing in achieving high accuracy, particularly in scenarios where traditional machine learning techniques may encounter difficulties. These findings contribute to the development of more accurate and efficient document classification systems for Arabic data. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",,Computing Methodologies; Humans; Language; Machine Learning; Quantum Theory; Sentiment Analysis; Social Media; Arabic (language); article; comparative study; controlled study; human; human experiment; machine learning; random forest; recall; sentiment analysis; social media; computer analysis; language; machine learning; quantum theory; sentiment analysis,,,,,"Department of Computer Science, Saarland University","Authors sincerely acknowledge Computer Science Department in Faculty of Science, Minia University for the facilities and support.","Muaad A.Y., Et al., Arabic document classification: Performance investigation of preprocessing and representation techniques, Math.

The primary aim is to assess their performance and delineate the current limitations and challenges associated with the application of these classifiers to complex tasks. The IMDB movie review dataset serves as a real-world example, while a generated dataset is employed for a simplified benchmark. The findings indicate that, although both classifiers exhibit potential in sentiment analysis, their performance on real-world datasets is impeded by factors such as limited qubit numbers, noise, and error rates in contemporary quantum hardware. This study underscores the necessity for advancements in quantum hardware and algorithms to enhance performance in sentiment analysis tasks and offers insights into potential avenues for future research. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Quantum Algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Sentiment Analysis,Classification (of information); Machine learning; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Machine-learning; Performance; Quantum algorithms; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Real-world datasets; Sentiment analysis; Support vector classifiers; Synthetic datasets; Sentiment analysis,,,,,,,"Zhang L., Liu B., Sentiment analysis and opinion mining, Encyclopedia of Machine Learning and Data Mining, (2012); Biamonte J., Wittek P., Pancotti N., Rebentrost P., Wiebe N., Lloyd S., Quantum machine learning, Nature, 549, 7671, pp. 195-202, (2017); Cerezo M., Verdon G., Huang H.Y., Cincio L., Coles P.J., Challenges and opportunities in quantum machine learning, Nat.

Already there exist applications running in quantum devices for different areas, like cybersecurity, chemistry, or machine learning. One subarea being developed under quantum machine learning is quantum natural language processing. Following the promising results existing in problems like sentiment classification or next-word prediction, this paper presents two proofs of concept to demonstrate how these two tasks can be solved using quantum computing. For the first task showcased, sentiment classification, we employ the removal of caps and cups morphisms to make the string diagrams simpler and more efficient. In the case of next-word prediction, we show how to solve the task for sentences with previously unknown syntactic structures by applying a classical Random Forest machine learning algorithm that classifies the syntactic structure and enables our QNLP algorithm to infer the proper string model. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Quantum computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum natural language processing,Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Syntactics; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum natural language processing; Sentiment classification; Syntactic structure; Word prediction; Machine learning,,,,,,,"Bauer C.W., Freytsis M., Nachman B., Simulating Collider Physics on Quantum Computers Using Effective Field Theories, (2021); Bennett C.H., Brassard G., Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing, Theor.

The compositional aspect of sentence and discourse units is often overlooked by machine learning algorithms. A recent initiative called Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) learns word meanings as points in a Hilbert space and acts on them via a translation of grammatical structure into Parametrised Quantum Circuits (PQCs). Previous work extended the QNLP translation to discourse structure using points in a closure of Hilbert spaces. In this paper, we evaluate this translation on a Winograd-style pronoun resolution task. We train a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) for binary classification and implement an end-to-end pronoun resolution system. The simulations executed on IBMQ software converged with an F1 score of 87.20%. The model outperformed two out of three classical coreference resolution systems and neared state-of-the-art SpanBERT. A mixed quantum-classical model yet improved these results with an F1 score increase of around 6%. © 2023 EMNLP 2023 - Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Computational Models of Reference, Anaphora and Coreference, CRAC 2023.

We re-implement a key representative set of these existing methods, adapting an image classification approach using quantum self-attention to create a quantum hybrid transformer that works for text and image classification, and applying quantum self-attention and quantum recurrent neural networks to natural language processing tasks. We also explore different encoding techniques and introduce positional encoding into quantum self-attention neural networks leading to improved accuracy and faster convergence in text and image classification experiments. This paper also performs a comparative analysis of classical self-attention models and their quantum counterparts, helping shed light on the differences in these models and their performance.  © 2024 IEEE.",quantum-computing; quantum-machine-learning; self-attention; transformers,Classification (of information); Encoding (symbols); Image classification; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Signal encoding; Text processing; Images classification; Machine-learning; Primary objective; Quantum Computing; Quantum machines; Quantum-machine-learning; Self-attention; Sequence models; Text classification; Transformer; Recurrent neural networks,,,,,,,"Sutskever I., Vinyals O., Le Q.V., Sequence to sequence learning with neural networks, Advances in neural information processing systems, (2014); Schmidt R.M., Recurrent neural networks (rnns): A gentle introduction and overview, (2019); Vaswani A., Et al., Attention is All you Need, Neural Information Processing Systems, (2017); Hochreiter S., Schmidhuber J., Long short-term memory, Neural computation, 9, 8, pp. 1735-1780, (1997); Cho K., Et al., Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for statistical machine translation, (2014); Devlin J., Et al., Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, (2018); Radford A., Narasimhan K., Salimans T., Sutskever I., Et al., Improving language understanding by generative pre-training, (2018); Huang H.-Y., Et al., Quantum advantage in learning from experiments, Science, 376, pp. 1182-1186, (2022); Schuld M., Supervised Learning with Quantum Computers, (2018); Zoufal C., Lucchi A., Woerner S., Quantum generative adversarial networks for learning and loading random distributions, npj Quant.

At the same time, in the area of quantum computing (QC), with the steady growth of quantum hardware and notable improvements towards implementations of quantum algorithms, we are approaching an era when quantum computers perform tasks that cannot be done on classical computers with a reasonable amount of resources. This provides an new range of opportunities for AI, and for NLP specifically. In this work, we work with the Categorical Distributional Compositional (DisCoCat) model of natural language meaning, whose underlying mathematical underpinnings make it amenable to quantum instantiations. Earlier work on fault-tolerant quantum algorithms has already demonstrated potential quantum advantage for NLP, notably employing DisCoCat. In this work, we focus on the capabilities of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware and perform the first implementation of an NLP task on a NISQ processor, using the DisCoCat framework. Sentences are instantiated as parameterised quantum circuits; word-meanings are embedded in quantum states using parameterised quantum-circuits and the sentence’s grammatical structure faithfully manifests as a pattern of entangling operations which compose the word-circuits into a sentence-circuit. The circuits’ parameters are trained using a classical optimiser in a supervised NLP task of binary classification. Our novel QNLP model shows concrete promise for scalability as the quality of the quantum hardware improves in the near future and solidifies a novel branch of experimental research at the intersection of QC and AI. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Compositionality; Natural language processing; Quantum computing; String diagrams,Computer hardware; Qubits; Compositionality; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Parameterized; Quanta computers; Quantum algorithms; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; String diagram; Natural language processing systems,,,,,Wolfson Harrison UK Research Council Quantum Foundation; Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851,KM is grateful to the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 for financial support under a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship.

The model is based on the authors' explorations on the identification of tweets meanings. The main idea is to apply the latest developed quantum machine learning method to the hierarchical classification models of texts. This approach avoids the text corpus necessity and supports the online learning due to the very design. The model proposed is tested in the experiment. The target content was given in the experiment and the model is used to measure the correspondence between the target topics and the test messages. The result of the experiment shows that the proposed method allows to distinguish the target content in the test text. © 2024 IEEE.,expert system; natural language model; online learning; short messages; tweets,E-learning; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Classification models; Hierarchical classification; Machine learning methods; Natural language model; Online learning; Quantum machines; Short message; Text corpora; Tweet; Expert systems,,,,,,,"LeCun Y., Boser B., Denker J.S., Henderson D., Howard R.E., Hubbard W., Jackel L.D., Backpropagation Applied to Handwritten Zip Code Recognition, Neural Computation, 1, 4, pp. 541-551, (1989); Krizhevsky A., Sutskever I., Hinton G.E., ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks, Communications of the ACM, 60, 6, pp. 84-90, (2012); Kim Y., Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification, Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 1746-1751, (2014); Bahdanau D., Cho K., Bengio Y., Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate, (2014); Vaswani A., Shazeer N., Parmar N., Uszkoreit J., Jones L., Gomez A.N., Polosukhin I., Attention is all you need, Advances in neural information processing systems, 30, (2017); Radford A., Narasimhan K., Salimans T., Sutskever I., Improving language understanding by generative pre-training, (2018); Devlin J., Chang M., Lee K., Toutanova K.N., BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, (2018); Kolmogorov A.N., Information theory and theory of algorithms, Selected works, URSS, 3, pp. 264-2005; Uspensky V.A., Preface for readers of the New Literary Review to the semiotic messages of A.

This paper explores a novel implementation of sentiment analysis using the Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) framework. As ansatz choice determines model performance in VQA, this paper proposes an alternative ansatz for the sentiment classification task in quantum representation. Specifically, it builds upon previous work in quantum sentiment classification by proposing an alternative ansatz to the Instantaneous Quantum Polytime ansatz, entitled Simple Sentiment Analysis (SimpleSA) ansatz. A key feature of the SimpleSA ansatz is the decision to neglect noun parameterization. The proposed SimpleSA has less complexity than the other ansätze in terms of the number of parameters and the number of gates. Moreover, experimental results show that the SimpleSA ansatz with H-CNOT-Rz-H compound block construction outperforms the Instantaneous Quantum Polytime (IQP) ansatz at 85.00% accuracy. Furthermore, SimpleSA optimization converges 20.89% faster than Instantaneous Quantum Polytime (IQP) for the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) method with 130 iterations. The proposed work is useful for applications of quantum computers for sentiment analyses and classifications.  © 2013 IEEE.",ansatz; quantum circuit; quantum machine learning; Quantum natural language processing; sentiment classification,Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Optimization; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Stochastic systems; Timing circuits; Ansatz; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Quantum circuit; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum natural language processing; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Sentiment analysis,,,,,,,"Coecke B., Sadrzadeh M., Clark S., Mathematical foundations for a compositional distributional model of meaning, (2010); Preskill J., Quantum computing in the NISQ era and beyond, Quantum, 2, (2018); Cerezo M., Arrasmith A., Babbush R., Benjamin S.C., Endo S., Fujii K., McClean J.R., Mitarai K., Yuan X., Cincio L., Coles P.J., Variational quantum algorithms, Nature Rev.

Sarcasm, emotion, and sentiment are related to each other, and hence any multitask model could be an effective way to leverage the interdependence among these tasks. In order to better represent these clandestine associations, we avoid solely relying on traditional machine learning methods to encode the relationships between the modalities. In this article, we propose a hybrid quantum model that banks upon the low computational complexity and robust representational power of a variational quantum circuit (VQC) and the tried and tested dense neural network to tackle sentiment, emotion, and sarcasm classification simultaneously. We empirically establish that the quantum properties like superposition, entanglement, and interference will better capture and replicate not only the cross-modal interactions between text, acoustics, and visuals but also the correlations between the three responses. We consider the extended MUStARD dataset to evaluate our proposed hybrid model. The results show that our proposed hybrid quantum framework yields more promising results for the primary task of sarcasm detection with the help of the two secondary classification tasks, viz. sentiment and emotion. © 2014 IEEE.",Hybrid quantum-classical neural network; multimodal data; quantum machine learning,Complex networks; Job analysis; Machine learning; Modal analysis; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Classical neural networks; Hybrid quantum-classical neural network; Interference; Machine-learning; Multi-modal data; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum state; Quantum system; Quantum-classical; Task analysis; Sentiment analysis,,,,,,,"Nielsen M.A., Chuang I.L., Grover L.K., Quantum computation and quantum information, Am.

In quantum-computing theory, the vectors corresponding to quantum states are all complex values, so there is a gap between these two areas. Presently, complex-valued neural networks have been studied, but their practical applications are few, let alone in the downstream tasks of natural language processing such as sentiment analysis and language modeling. In fact, the complex-valued neural network can use the imaginary part information to embed hidden information and can express more complex information, which is suitable for modeling complex natural language. Meanwhile, quantum-inspired models are defined in Hilbert space, which is also a complex space. So it is natural to construct quantum-inspired models based on complex-valued neural networks. Therefore, we propose a new quantum-inspired model for NLP, ComplexQNN, which contains a complex-valued embedding layer, a quantum encoding layer, and a measurement layer. The modules of ComplexQNN are fully based on complex-valued neural networks. It is more in line with quantum-computing theory and easier to transfer to quantum computers in the future to achieve exponential acceleration. We conducted experiments on six sentiment-classification datasets comparing with five classical models (TextCNN, GRU, ELMo, BERT, and RoBERTa). The results show that our model has improved by 10% in accuracy metric compared with TextCNN and GRU, and has competitive experimental results with ELMo, BERT, and RoBERTa. © 2023 by the authors.",machine learning; natural language processing; quantum theory; sentiment analysis,,,,,,"Open Fund of Advanced Cryptography and System Security Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, (SKLACSS-202107); Special Foundation for Distinguished Young Scientists of Changsha, (kq1905058); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61972418, 62272483); Education Department of Henan Province, (22B0001)","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 62272483, 61972418), the Education Department of Hunan Province of China (Grant Nos. 22B0001), the Special Foundation for Distinguished Young Scientists of Changsha (Grant Nos. kq1905058) and the Open Fund of Advanced Cryptography and System Security Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province (Grant Nos.

We explore feature and data prototype selection techniques to address challenges posed by encoding high dimensional features. Our study builds quantum circuit classifiers that includes classical feature pre-processing, quantum embedding and quantum model training. The quantum models are built on 4 or 6 qubits and the quantum neural network (QNN) uses the established bricklayer design. We compare the dependence of model performance (in terms of accuracy and F1 scores) on feature length, embedding gates and parameterized unitary design. We compare the performance of quantum machine learning models to classical convolution neural network model (CNN) on binary and multi-class classification tasks using two datasets of synthetic features and labels. The first is the ECP-CANDLE P3B3 dataset a corpus of synthetically generated cancer pathology reports. The second dataset is extracted from well-known benchmark dataset (MADELON) - features are generated with a combination of informative, repeated and uninformative features. Both datasets are used for binary classification and multi-class classification with 3 classes. We observe robust, accurate performance from all models on the binary classification tasks, but multiclass classification is a challenge for the quantum models-there is a notable decrease in accuracy when using 3 classes. Overall the performance is comparable in terms of recall and accuracy between QNNs and CNNs, even with large datasets. These results provide a point of comparison between quantum and classical models on real-world datasets.  © 2023 IEEE.",quantum machine learning; quantum natural language processing; quantum neural networks,Classification (of information); Classifiers; Large dataset; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Qubits; Embeddings; Language processing; Machine-learning; Multi-class classification; Natural languages; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum models; Quantum natural language processing; Quantum neural networks; Embeddings,,,,,,,"Coecke B., De Felice G., Meichanetzidis K., Toumi A., Foundations for near-term quantum natural language processing, (2020); Lorenz R., Pearson A., Meichanetzidis K., Kartsaklis D., Coecke B., Qnlp in practice: Running compositional models of meaning on a quantum computer, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 76, pp. 1305-1342, (2023); Guarasci R., De Pietro G., Esposito M., Quantum natural language processing: Challenges and opportunities, Appl.

Our approach focuses on Question-answering on a set of sentences, whether a particular sentence is truthful with respect to the whole corpus of sentences. We employ the Categorical Distributional Compositional (DisCoCat) model to translate sentences to valid quantum circuits. We achieve a fitting score of 97% on the test set. Our sentence set is also significantly larger than previous experiments. The results show general applicability of the framework to other languages. We also show that it can be used to introspect natural language models and provide new approaches to model explainability. © 2023 IEEE.",DisCoCat; Natural Language Processing; QNLP; Quantum Natural Language Processing,Chinese language;

NLP classical approaches are computationally expensive due to their high-power consumption, computing power, and storage requirements. Another computationally efficient approach to NLP is categorical quantum mechanics, which combines grammatical structure and individual word meaning to deduce the sentence meaning. As both quantum theory and natural language use vector space to describe states which are more efficient on quantum hardware, QNLP models can achieve up to quadratic speedup over classical direct calculation methods. In recent years, there is significant progress in utilizing quantum features such as superposition and entanglement to represent linguistic meaning on quantum hardware. Earlier research work has already demonstrated QNLP’s potential quantum advantage in terms of speeding up search, enhancing classification tasks’ accuracy and providing an exponentially large quantum state space in which complex linguistic structures can be efficiently embedded. In this work, a QNLP model is used to determine if two sentences are related to the same topic or not. By comparing our QNLP model to a classical tensor network-based one, our model improved training accuracy by up to 45% and validation accuracy by 35%, respectively. The QNLP model convergence is also studied when varying: first, the problem size, second, parametrized quantum circuits used for model’s training, and last, the backend quantum simulator noise model. The experimental results show that strongly entangled ansatz designs result in fastest model convergence. © 2023, The Author(s).",Classification; Hybrid quantum-classical; Quantum natural language processing; Quantum neural network; Supervised learning,Computational linguistics; Computing power; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Quantum entanglement; Supervised learning; Vector spaces; 'current; Classical modeling; Hybrid quantum-classical; Language model; Language processing; Model convergence; Natural languages; Quantum natural language processing; Quantum neural networks; Quantum-classical; Classification (of information),,,,,,,"Georgescu I.M., Ashhab S., Nori F., Quantum simulation, Rev Mod Phys, 86, 1, (2014); Coecke B., Gdmeichanetzidis K., Toumi A., Quantum Computing in the Arts and Humanities, pp. 277-297, (2022); Zeng W.J., Coecke B, (2016); Aaronson S., Chen L., Complexity-theoretic foundations of quantum supremacy experiments, Arxiv, 1612, (2016); Zhu D., Kahanamoku-Meyer G.D., Lewis L., Noel C., Katz O., Harraz B., Wang Q., Risinger A., Feng L., Biswas D., Interactive protocols for classically-verifiable quantum advantage, Arxiv, 2112, (2021); Brakerski Z., Koppula V., Vazirani U., Vidick T., Simpler proofs of quantumness, .

Such data can be used to improve the quality or assess the effectiveness of pharmaceutical product. This effort aims to assess the medical conditions of a patient by analyzing the text reviews of pharmaceutical products, and thereby increase the patient's healthcare quality. Recently new computing paradigms like quantum machine learning gained a lot of attention. However, it is not yet feasible to perform quantum operations on high dimensional data using current quantum hardware. Hence a hybrid approach using both classical and quantum machine learning methods has been proposed. We compared our results with the performance of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) model. The result shows the promise of quantum computing technology when used in combination with a classical machine learning approach. In comparison to the current state-of-the-art technology, where the transformer-based techniques achieved 85.7% of accuracy, our hybrid approach achieved 87.1% accuracy.  © 2023 IEEE.",BERT; Medical Drug Reviews; Natural Language Processing; Quantum Machine Learning; Variational Quantum Circuits,Clustering algorithms; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Timing circuits; Bidirectional encoder representation from transformer; Language processing; Machine-learning; Medical drug review; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Quantum circuit; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Variational quantum circuit; Consumer behavior,,,,,,,"Devlin J., Chang M.-W., Lee K., Toutanova K., Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, (2019); Biamonte J., Wittek P., Pancotti N., Rebentrost P., Wiebe N., Lloyd S., Quantum machine learning, Nature, 549, 7671, pp. 195-202, (2017); Cerezo M., Arrasmith A., Babbush R., Benjamin S.C., Endo S., Fujii K., McClean J.R., Mitarai K., Yuan X., Cincio L., Et al., Variational quantum algorithms, Nature Reviews Physics, 3, 9, pp. 625-644, (2021); Mitarai K., Negoro M., Kitagawa M., Fujii K., Quantum circuit learning, Physical Review A, (2018); Graser F., Kallumadi S., Malberg H., Zaunseder S., Aspect-based sentiment analysis of drug reviews applying cross-domain and cross-data learning, Proceedings of the 2018 International Conference on Digital Health, (2018); Wang H., Ding Y., Gu J., Lin Y., Pan D.Z., Chong F.T., Han S., Quantumnas: Noise-adaptive search for robust quantum circuits, (2021); Li J., Yang X.D., Peng X., Pu Sun C., Hybrid quantum-classical approach to quantum optimal control, Physical review letters, 118, 15, (2017)",,Muller H.; Alexev Y.; Delgado A.; Byrd G.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,et al.; Microsoft; Montreal International; Q-CTRL; QBlox; Quantum Machines (QM),"4th IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2023",17 September 2023 through 22 September 2023,Bellevue,195032.0,,979-835034323-6,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

This capability makes it applicable in various fields, such as natural language processing, image processing, and computer vision. Deep learning models show effective performance but face challenges such as complexity and resource demands. On the other hand, quantum machine learning algorithms offer an alternative with potential efficiency compared to their classical counterparts. This paper proposes a Quantum Recurrent Neural Network (QRNN) for natural language processing tasks, which classify text data such as parts of speech, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. The proposed method utilizes parameterized quantum circuits that contain the tunable parameters.

In the financial sector, sentiments such as confidence or fear play a pivotal role in shaping market dynamics, influencing supply and demand, and precipitating significant price fluctuations. The timely extraction of sentiment from sources like financial news articles and social media posts is crucial for devising informed investment strategies. Despite its importance, current approaches to sentiment analysis in finance have not fully harnessed the potential of emerging technologies, such as large language models (LLMs) and quantum computing models. These cutting-edge technologies have demonstrated remarkable success in other areas of natural language processing (NLP), but their application in financial sentiment analysis remains limited. This paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel quantum model for text representation, specifically designed for the financial domain. Our approach integrates this quantum representation with a vector-based representation generated by a pre-trained LLM specialized in finance. The resulting fusion of these two representations yields a more comprehensive input for an LLM, leading to a significant enhancement in the accuracy of the sentiment analysis task. We evaluate our approach through extensive experimental tests on a publicly available dataset and demonstrate that our quantum-based method outperforms state-of-the-art models on a widely recognized financial sentiment analysis benchmark. Our results highlight the potential of integrating quantum computing principles with traditional NLP methods for more accurate and effective sentiment analysis in finance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Large Language Models; Sentiment Analysis; Zero-shot Learning,Benchmarking; Economic and social effects; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Investments; Quantum optics; Sentiment analysis; Financial sectors; Indispensable tools; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Market dynamics; Natural languages; Political communication; Price fluctuation; Sentiment analysis; Zero-shot learning,,,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LY23F020010); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62077015, 2024C03262); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Jinhua Science and Technology Plan, (2023-3-003a)","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province under Grant (LY23F020010), the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant (62077015), the \u201CPioneer\u201D and \u201CLeading Goose\u201D R&D Program of Zhejiang (No. 2024C03262), and the Jinhua Science and Technology Plan (No. 2023-3-003a).

Through the application of Quantum-Accelerated Hyperparameter Tuning (QAHT), this abstract introduces a novel approach to addressing this issue. Our proposed framework leverages quantum computing capabilities to dynamically optimize NLP model hyperparameters in real-time, catering to the ever-changing character of textual data streams. Traditional hyperparameter optimisation methods usually rely on laborious grid searches or random exploration, which may not be suitable for dynamic NLP jobs. Contrarily, QAHT uses Quantum Neural Network (QNN) architectures that have been specially designed for hyperparameter optimisation. These QNNs improve performance and efficacy by dynamically modifying and improving model configurations. This abstract discusses the key elements of the QAHT architecture, including real-time model deployment, adaptive learning, and continuous data stream processing. In addition to speeding up the hyperparameter optimisation process, QAHT makes sure that NLP models are still flexible and responsive to shifts in the sentiment of the data and its distribution. This method has applications beyond NLP since it provides a foundation for effectively optimising machine learning models in complex, real-time situations.

However, in low-resource regions such as South Asia, where languages like Bengali are widely used, the research interest is relatively low compared to high-resource regions due to limited computational resources, flexible word order, and high inflectional nature of the language. With the development of quantum technology, quantum machine learning models leverage the superposition property of qubits to enhance model expressiveness and achieve faster computation compared to classical systems. To promote the development of quantum machine learning in low-resource language domains, we propose a quantum-classical hybrid architecture. This architecture utilizes a pretrained multilingual bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT) model to obtain vector representations of words and combines the proposed batch upload quantum recurrent neural network (BUQRNN) and parameter nonshared batch upload quantum recurrent neural network (PN-BUQRNN) as feature extraction models for sentiment analysis in Bengali. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed BUQRNN structure achieves a maximum accuracy improvement of 0.993% in Bengali text classification tasks while reducing average model complexity by 12%. The PN-BUQRNN structure surpasses the BUQRNN structure once again and outperforms classical architectures in certain tasks. © 2020 IEEE.",Natural language processing (NLP); quantum machine learning; quantum recurrent neural network,Classification (of information); Data mining; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network architecture; Sentiment analysis; Bengalis; Language processing; Low resource languages; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Neural networks structure; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum recurrent neural network; Recurrent neural networks,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62071240); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20231142); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology, (2021ZD0302901)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62071240, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province under Grant BK20231142, and in part by the Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology under Grant 2021ZD0302901.","Grefenstette J.J., Genetic algorithms and machine learning, Proc. 6th Annu.

Let n and d represent the length of the sequence and the embedding size, respectively. The dot-product attention mechanism requires a time complexity of O(n2 ·d), while QNet has merely O(n+d) quantum circuit depth. In addition, we introduce ResQNet, a quantum-classical hybrid model composed of several QNet blocks linked by residual connections, as an isomorph Transformer Encoder. We evaluated our work on various natural language processing tasks, including text classification, rating score prediction, and named entity recognition. Our models exhibit compelling performance over classical state-of-the-art models with a thousand times fewer parameters.

Its theoretical results on quantum circuit mapping and quantum semantic coding of text have been tested in practice with the recent development of quantum back-end equipment. In view of the small scale of quantum natural language processing tasks, single sentence structure of quantum semantic coding, low text coverage and lack of application, this paper proposes a combination of syntactic structure to extract text and extend the sentence components of quantum semantic coding, which improves the utilization of text processing task of quantum computing resources. In view of the fact that quantum natural language processing has few cases in specific applications, this paper studies the application expansion possibility of quantum text matching and question answering applications. The development path of classical natural language processing is referred to enhance the usefulness and explore the practical ability of QNLP in the current resource-constrained conditions.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",DisCoCat model; natural language processing; Quantum computing,,,,,,,,"Wu C., Et al., Phys.

This paper describes an approach for quantum video classification which combines video captioning and quantum natural language processing (QNLP) techniques. The proposed approach involves generating captions for videos and using these captions to produce quantum circuits, which are fed as inputs to a classifier running on a quantum simulator. This technique essentially reduces the quantum video classification problem into a quantum text classification problem. The text-based quantum circuits generated for videos also serve the purpose of acting as a new type of dataset for further research on quantum video processing. The proposed quantum video classifier performs well, with an accuracy of 89 percent when trained and tested on a subset of the kinetics dataset. © 2023 IEEE.",lambeq; mPLUG-2; Quantum computing; quantum entanglement; Quantum Natural Language Processing; Quantum Video Classification; Quantum Video Processing; qubit; string diagram; superposition,Classification (of information); Natural language processing systems; Qubits; Text processing; Video signal processing; Lambeq; Language processing; MPLUG-2; Natural languages; Quantum Computing; Quantum natural language processing; Quantum video classification; Quantum video processing; String diagram; Superposition; Video classification; Video processing; Quantum entanglement,,,,,RVCE,The authors thank the staff of RVCE for their support and guidance to conduct research in a relatively new branch of computing.,"Hidary J.D., Quantum Computing: An Applied Approach, (2019); Qiskit, (2023); Cirq, (2023); Kartsaklis D., Fan I., Yeung R., Pearson A., Lorenz R., Toumi A., Et al., lambeq: an efficient high-level python library for quantum NLP, (2021); Blekos K., Kosmopoulos D., A quantum 3D convolutional neural network with application in video classification, Advances in Visual Computing, virtual event, pp. 601-612, (2021); Blekos K., Kosmopoulos D., Quantum data reduction with application to video classification, IEEE/ACM 7th Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC), pp. 430-435, (2022); Preskill J., Quantum computing in the NISQ era and beyond, Quantum, 2, (2018); Jiang S., Gan Z., Li D., A comprehensive survey of recent advances in video object detection, (2019); Wang L., Qiao Y., Tang X., Video action detection with relational dynamic-pose graphs, Proc. of the IEEE International Conf. on Computer Vision, pp. 3234-3243, (2019); Simonyan K., Zisserman A., Two-Stream convolutional networks for action recognition in videos, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 568-576, (2014); Harrow A.W., Small quantum computers and large classical data sets, (2020); Chen D., Dolan W., Collecting highly parallel data for paraphrase evaluation, Proc. of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pp. 190-200, (2011); Xu J., Mei T., Yao T., Rui Y., MSR-VTT: A large video description dataset for bridging video and language, Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 5288-5296, (2016); Vedantam R., Zitnick C.L., Parikh D., CIDEr: Consensus-based image description evaluation, IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 4566-4575, (2015); Chen S., He X., Guo L., Zhu X., Wang W., Tang J., Liu J., Valor: Vision-audio-language omni-perception pretraining model and dataset, (2023); He X., Chen S., Ma F., Huang Z., Jin X., Liu Z., Et al., VLAB: Enhancing Video Language Pre-training by Feature Adapting and Blending, (2023); Radford A., Kim J.W., Hallacy C., Ramesh A., Goh G., Agarwal S., Et al., Learning transferable visual models from natural language supervision, Proc. of the 38th International Conference on Machine Learning, virtual event, pp. 8748-8763, (2021); Chen S., Li H., Wang Q., Zhao Z., Sun M., Zhu X., Et al., VAST: A Vision-Audio-Subtitle-Text Omni-Modality Foundation Model and Dataset, (2023); Xu H., Ye Q., Yan M., Shi Y., Ye J., Xu Y., Et al., mPLUG-2: A Modularized Multi-modal Foundation Model Across Text, Image and Video, (2023); Buszkowski W., Lambek grammars based on pregroups, Proceedings of the International Conference on Logical Aspects of Computational Linguistics, pp. 95-109, (2001); Meichanetzidis K., Toumi A., de Felice G., Coecke B., Grammar-aware sentence classification on quantum computers, (2023); Lorenz P., Meichanetzidis K., Coecke, QNLP in Practice: Running Compositional Models of Meaning on a Quantum Computer, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 76, pp. 1305-1342, (2023); Broughton M., Verdon G., McCourt T., Martinez A.J., Yoo J.H., Isakov S.V., Et al., TensorFlow Quantum: A Software Framework for Quantum Machine Learning, (2021); Bergholm V., Izaac J., Schuld M., Gogolin C., Ahmed S., Ajith V., PennyLane: Automatic differentiation of hybrid quantum-classical computations, (2022); Carreira J., Noland E., Hillier C., Zisserman A., A Short Note on the Kinetics-700 Human Action Dataset, (2022)",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"4th International Conference on Communication, Computing and Industry 6.0, C216 2023",15 December 2023 through 16 December 2023,"Hybrid, Bangalore",197424.0,,979-835032732-8,,,English,"Int.

An interesting field in Machine Learning is Sequence Modelling, having Natural Language Processing as the peak of the field. The capabilities of Quantum Computing have been growing recently entering the novel field of Quantum Machine Learning. In this paper, we propose a Quantum Natural Language Processing classification model named Strongly Entangling Neural Network. This model leverages the quantum advantage to imitate part of the behavior of a Recurrent Neural Network to process text data into the circuit and perform the classification task. This is accomplished by representing our data in a quantum circuit that relies heavily on the entanglement property of qubits. The results of our model have very favorable metrics, particularly obtaining a 97.70% of accuracy. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Quantum information; Quantum machine learning; Quantum natural processing,Learning algorithms; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Quantum entanglement; Quantum optics; Qubits; Text processing; Hybrid model; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Neural-networks; Quantum Information; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum natural processing; Quantum-classical; Recurrent neural networks,,,,,"Institute for the Future of Education, Tecnologico de Monterrey; Novus International, (214); Novus International","J.

Some research works substantially exploit Machine Learning algorithms to identify threats conducted on vehicles, particularly on the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Therefore, it is necessary not only to use Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) to identify attacks but also to help the engineers in the automotive field understand the dangerousness of the attack and help them resolve the vulnerability. With the increasing attention to Quantum Computing (QC), QC-based Artificial Intelligence algorithms have become very popular among many researchers for improving the prediction and the time performance to identify an attack.

The integration of these state-of-the-art technologies is fueled by the necessity to improve language models' capacity to comprehend context and make precise decisions. This research paper presents a novel approach to revolutionize the staffing and recruiting industry by integrating Knowledge Graph (KG) and Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) to formulate an end-to-end QNLP training pipeline. The proposed solution consists of three interdependent subsystems that work in unison to construct contextual KG and train language models. The Information Extraction subsystem extracts semantic relationships and connections between entities from large and complex recruitment data to construct domain specific contextual KG. The QNLP model training pipeline subsystem, which is fed with domain-rich KG data, runs on Quantum Circuits, accelerates the training process by effectively incorporating high-dimensional features to the deep layers of language models. Finally, the Information Retrieval subsystem is based on semantic data taxonomy, retrieving contextual data from the KG for the trained language models to be implemented on various distinctive use cases in the staffing and recruiting industry.

However, the essential prior knowledge and pretrained text features are often ignored at the early stage of the development of quantum-inspired models. To attacking the above challenges, a pretrained quantum-inspired deep neural network is proposed in this work, which is constructed based on quantum theory for carrying out strong performance and great interpretability in related NLP fields. Concretely, a quantum-inspired pretrained feature embedding (QPFE) method is first developed to model superposition states for words to embed more textual features. Then, a QPFE-ERNIE model is designed by merging the semantic features learned from the prevalent pretrained model ERNIE, which is verified with two NLP downstream tasks: 1) sentiment classification and 2) word sense disambiguation (WSD). In addition, schematic quantum circuit diagrams are provided, which has potential impetus for the future realization of quantum NLP with quantum device. Finally, the experiment results demonstrate QPFE-ERNIE is significantly better for sentiment classification than gated recurrent unit (GRU), BiLSTM, and TextCNN on five datasets in all metrics and achieves better results than ERNIE in accuracy, F1-score, and precision on two datasets (CR and SST), and it also has advantage for WSD over the classical models, including BERT (improves F1-score by 5.2 on average) and ERNIE (improves F1-score by 4.2 on average) and improves the F1-score by 8.7 on average compared with a previous quantum-inspired model QWSD. QPFE-ERNIE provides a novel pretrained quantum-inspired model for solving NLP problems, and it lays a foundation for exploring more quantum-inspired models in the future.  © 2024 The Authors.

Security concerns motivate the development of quantum pre-training. In this work, we propose a highly portable quantum language model (PQLM) that can easily transmit information to downstream tasks on classical machines. The framework consists of a cloud PQLM built with random Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC) and local models for downstream applications. We demonstrate the ad hoc portability of the quantum model by extracting only the word embeddings and effectively applying them to downstream tasks on classical machines. Our PQLM exhibits comparable performance to its classical counterpart on both intrinsic evaluation (loss, perplexity) and extrinsic evaluation (multilingual sentiment analysis accuracy) metrics. We also perform ablation studies on the factors affecting PQLM performance to analyze model stability. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for a portable quantum pre-trained language model that could be trained on private data and made available for public use with privacy protection guarantees. © 2023 IEEE.",Federated Learning; Language Modeling; Model Portability; Quantum Machine Learning,Computational linguistics; Learning systems; Modeling languages; Decentralised; Down-stream; Federated learning; Language model; Machine-learning; Malicious agent; Model portability; Private information; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Sentiment analysis,,,,,,,"Bommasani R., Hudson D.A., Adeli E., Altman R., Arora S., Von Arx S., Bernstein M.S., Bohg J., Bosselut A., Brunskill E., Et al., On the opportunities and risks of foundation models, (2021); Wu S., Zhao X., Yu T., Zhang R., Shen C., Liu H., Li F., Zhu H., Luo J., Xu L., Zhang X., Yuan 1. 0: Large-scale pre-trained language model in zero-shot and few-shot learning, (2021); Shi W., Cui A., Li E., Jia R., Yu Z., Selective differential privacy for language modeling, Proceedings of the 2022 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pp. 2848-2859, (2022); Carlini N., Liu C., Erlingsson U., Kos J., Song D., The secret sharer: Evaluating and testing unintended memorization in neural networks, 28th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 19), pp. 267-284, (2019); Carlini N., Tramer F., Wallace E., Jagielski M., Herbert-Voss A., Lee K., Roberts A., Brown T., Song D., Erlingsson U., Oprea A., Raffel C., Extracting training data from large language models, 30th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 21)., pp. 2633-2650, (2021); Brown H., Lee K., Mireshghallah F., Shokri R., Tramer F., What does it mean for a language model to preserve privacy, 2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, pp. 2280-2292, (2022); Zaib M., Sheng Q.Z., Emma Zhang W., A short survey of pre-trained language models for conversational ai-a new age in nlp, Proceedings of the Australasian Computer Science Week Multiconference, (2020); Reitmaier T., Wallington E., Kalarikalayil Raju D., Klejch O., Pearson J., Jones M., Bell P., Robinson S., Opportunities and challenges of automatic speech recognition systems for low-resource language speakers, Proceedings of the 2022 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, (2022); Watkins W.M., Chen S.Y.-C., Yoo S., Quantum machine learning with differential privacy, Scientific Reports, 13, 1, (2023); Shaffer D., Chamon C., Hamma A., Mucciolo E.R., Irreversibility and entanglement spectrum statistics in quantum circuits, Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, 2014, 12, (2014); Huck Yang C.-H., Qi J., Chen S.Y.-C., Chen P.-Y., Marco Siniscalchi S., Ma X., Lee C.-H., Decentralizing feature extraction with quantum convolutional neural network for automatic speech recognition, Proc.

To explore the structural relationships between quantum theory and natural languages Lambeq toolkit was created. This first high-level open-source Python toolkit for quantum natural language processing offers a fully automated quantum machine learning pipeline. Lambeq currently includes five compositional models that use varying degrees of syntactic information. While the previous studies focus on Discocat model, the aim of this study is to conducte an extensive evaluation of various classifiers based on different compositional models for text classification applications, focusing on the potential advantages of ensemble learning. The classifiers, including Spider, Cups, Stairs, Tree, and DisCoCat, were examined on two datasets: MC and RP. Performance evaluation was carried out using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as the metrics. The results revealed notable variations in the performance of the classifiers across the datasets. Spider emerged as the top-performing classifier on the MC dataset, achieving remarkable scores of 100% in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. However, on the RP dataset, Stairs outperformed the other classifiers with an accuracy of 68%, precision of 71%, recall of 68%, and F1-score of 69%. Furthermore, ensemble models using hard voting and soft voting techniques were constructed and evaluated. The ensemble models showcased improved performance compared to individual classifiers, with the soft voting ensemble achieving a score of 97% for all metrics on the MC dataset, and a precision of 72% and F1-score of 68% on the RP dataset. These findings highlight the potential benefits of ensemble learning in enhancing the overall performance of text classification tasks on both the MC and RP datasets using soft voting method, allowing for more accurate and reliable predictions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Ensemble Learning; Quantum machine learning; Quantum natural language processing; Quantum Text Classifier,Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; High level languages; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Quantum entanglement; Stairs; Text processing; Ensemble learning; F1 scores; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Quantum natural language processing; Quantum text classifier; Text classifiers; Machine learning,,,,,,,"Coecke B., de Felice G., Meichanetzidis K., Toumi A., Foundations for Near-Term Quantum Natural Language Processing.

The comprehensive QMNN model is structured into four fundamental blocks: multimodal data preprocessing, unimodal feature extraction, multimodal feature fusion, and optimization. Through these blocks, multimodal data are initially preprocessed and encoded into quantum states. Subsequently, visual and textual features are extracted from the quantum states and are then integrated in order to learn the interactions between different modalities. Finally, the model parameters are fine-tuned to optimize the sentiment analysis performance. Simulation results confirm that QMNN surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, using significantly lower input dimensions and substantially fewer parameters than classical models. Furthermore, the entanglement, integrity, robustness, and scalability of the model are analyzed in depth. Internally, the strong entanglement within the multimodal fusion block enhances interactions between textual and visual features, and the integrity of the model reflects the indispensable contribution of each component to the overall performance. Externally, robustness ensures the model operates stably under noisy conditions and incomplete inputs, and scalability enables it to efficiently adapt to varying architectural depths and widths. The above simulation results and performance analyses showcase the comprehensive strength of our proposed model.  © 2020 IEEE.",Multimodal sentiment analysis; quantum multimodal neural network (QMNN);

To analyze attitudes and emotions in textual data, handling large datasets and significant computational power is essential. Traditional computing methods struggle with the growing data volume, prompting interest in quantum computing as a promising alternative with its inherent high-speed processing capacity. This study focuses on sentiment analysis applied to texts derived from bilateral conversation dialogues. The primary objective is to categorize emotions within the text as positive, neutral, or negative, while concurrently identifying the speaker. To achieve this, a novel quantum-classical hybrid approach is proposed. The quantum side of this approach includes the variational quantum circuit (VQC). On the classical side, preprocessing of the data set, feature extraction with a model containing LSTM, and optimizing the parameters of VQC are performed. The proposed approach was trained and tested using a data set containing bilateral conversations. As a result of the tests, the proposed approach achieved a higher accuracy rate compared to studies using the classical approach. Thus, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is confirmed.  © 2024 IEEE.",deep learning; natural language processing; quantum computing; sentiment analysis,Data handling; High speed cameras; Large datasets; Long short-term memory; Quantum computers; Data set; Deep learning; Language processing; Media and politics; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Sentiment analysis; Textual data; Sentiment analysis,,,,,"Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştırma Kurumu, TÜBİTAK, (121E439)",This study was supported by the TUBITAK (The Scientific and Tech- nological Research Council of Turkey) under Grant No: 121E439.,"Al Mursyidy Fadhlurrahman J., Ayu Herawati N., Rachma Widya Aulya H., Puspasari I., Priya Utama N., Sentiment analysis of game reviews on steam using bert, bilstm, and crf, 2023 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics (ICEEI), (2023); Furkan Bar N., Karakose M., A dnn based approach to automatically generating operator matrix in quantum computing, International Conference on Innovative Engineering Technologies (ICIET), (2023); Furkan Bar N., Yetis H., Karakose M., An approach based on quantum reinforcement learning for navigation problems, 2022 International Conference on Data Analytics for Business and Industry (ICDABI), (2022); Furkan Bar N., Yetis H., Karakose M., An efficient and scalable variational quantum circuits approach for deep reinforcement learning, Quantum Information Processing, 22, 8, (2023); Furkan Bar N., Yetis H., Karakose M., A quantumclassical hybrid classifier using multi-encoding method for images, 2023 27th International Conference on Information Technology (IT), (2023); Chien A.A., Karamcheti V., Moores law: The first ending and a new beginning, Computer, 46, 12, (2013); Dhola K., Saradva M., A comparative evaluation of traditional machine learning and deep learning classification techniques for sentiment analysis, 2021 11th International Conference on Cloud Computing, Data Science & Engineering (Confluence), (2021); Ganguly S., Nandan Morapakula S., Miguel Pozo Coronado L., Quantum natural language processing based sentiment analysis using lambeq toolkit, 2022 Second International Conference on Power, Control and Computing Technologies (ICPC2T), (2022); Goularas D., Kamis S., Evaluation of deep learning techniques in sentiment analysis from twitter data, 2019 International Conference on Deep Learning and Machine Learning in Emerging Applications (Deep-ML), (2019); Hagenau M., Liebmann M., Neumann D., Automated news reading: Stock price prediction based on financial news using context-capturing features, Decision Support Systems, 55, 3, (2013); Li S., Hou Y., Quantum-inspired model based on convolutional neural network for sentiment analysis, 2021 4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Big Data (ICAIBD), (2021); Maks I., Vossen P., A lexicon model for deep sentiment analysis and opinion mining applications, Decision Support Systems, 53, 4, (2012); Pandey S., Jyoti Basisth N., Sachan T., Kumari N., Pakray P., Quantum machine learning for natural language processing application, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 627, (2023); Pandya V., Somthankar A., Shrivastava S.S., Patil M., Twitter sentiment analysis using machine learning and deep learning techniques, 2021 2nd International Conference on Communication, Computing and Industry 4.0 (C2I4), (2021); Eid Rizk Y., Medhat Asal W., Sentiment analysis using machine learning and deep learning models on movies reviews, 2021 3rd Novel Intelligent and Leading Emerging Sciences Conference (NILES), (2021); Zakhralativa Ruskanda F., Rifat Abiwardani M., Mulyawan R., Syafalni I., Tatimma Larasati H., Quantumenhanced support vector machine for sentiment classification, IEEE Access, 11, (2023); Zakhralativa Ruskanda F., Rifat Abiwardani M., Syafalni I., Tatimma Larasati H., Mulyawan R., Simple sentiment analysis ansatz for sentiment classification in quantum natural language processing, IEEE Access, 11, (2023); Tsytsarau M., Palpanas T., Survey on mining subjective data on the web, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 24, 3, (2011); Tuah E., Zakhralativa Ruskanda F., Sentiment analysis of political party news on the online news portal detik.com using lstm and cnn, 2023 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics (ICEEI), (2023); Xu T., Peng Q., Cheng Y., Identifying the semantic orientation of terms using s-hal for sentiment analysis, Knowledge-Based Systems, 35, (2012); Yu L.-C., Wu J.-L., Chang P.-C., Chu H.-S., Using a contextual entropy model to expand emotion words and their intensity for the sentiment classification of stock market news, Knowledge-Based Systems, 41, (2013)","N.F.

Machine learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence which makes computers learn patterns from experiences. Due to the exponential growth of data, machine learning algorithms may be insufficient for big data, whereas on other side quantum computing can do fast computing. A combination of quantum computing and machine learning gave rise to a new field known as quantum machine learning. Quantum machine learning algorithms take advantage of the fast processing of quantum computing and show speedup compared to their classical counterpart. Natural language processing is another area of artificial intelligence that enables the computer to understand human languages. Now, researchers are trying to take advantage of quantum machine learning speedup in natural language processing applications. In this paper, first, we discuss the path from quantum computing to quantum machine learning. Then we review the state of the art of quantum machine learning for natural language processing applications. We also provide classical and quantum-based long short-term memory for parts of speech tagging on social media code mixed language. Our experiment shows that quantum-based long short-term memory performance is better than classical long short-term memory for parts of speech tagging of code-mixed datasets. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Natural language processing; POS tagging; Quantum computing; Quantum machine learning,Brain; Codes (symbols); Computational linguistics; Long short-term memory; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Syntactics; Language processing; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural language processing applications; Natural languages; POS tagging; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Learning algorithms,,,,,MeitY Quantum Computing Applications Lab,"The work presented here falls under the Research Project Grant Ref.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) stands out as a pivotal tool, particularly in analyzing vast troves of unstructured data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The application of Transformer-based NLP models, such as BERT and GPT, in extracting Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) information from EHRs to offer insight into factors that extend beyond clinical indicators to influence patient health. Despite the significance of SDOH in healthcare, their extraction from EHRs remains underexplored. This study aims to demonstrate the efficacy of quantum computing-based NLP in identifying and categorizing SDOH information. Through systematic investigation, this study contributes to advancing healthcare interventions by providing insights into patient health beyond clinical indicators. © 2024 IEEE.",artificial intelligence; data science; natural language processing; transformer-based models,Data Analytics; Economic and social effects; Natural language processing systems; Electronic health; Health informations; Health records; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Patient health; Quantum Computing; Social determinants of healths; Transformer-based model; Electronic health record,,,,,,,"Roosan D., Law A.V., Roosan M.R., Li Y., Artificial intelligent context-aware machine-learning tool to detect adverse drug events from social media platforms, J.

The distributional compositional categorical (DisCoCat) model is a framework that can both capture the distributional information of words and the syntactic structure of sentence. Thus, we research the application of DisCoCat models in both quantum and classical natural language processing. Specifically, in classical and quantum natural language processing, we respectively converted sentences into tensor networks and quantum circuits based on the DisCoCat model to get representation containing both semantic and syntactic information of language in classical and quantum computer. We conduct experiment for a text binary classification task in both classical and quantum natural language processing setting to verify the effectiveness of DisCoCat model. The experimental results shown that the combination of DisCoCat with quantum computing has significant potential. © 2024 IEEE.",DisCoCat; QNLP; text representation,Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Quantum electronics; Semantics; Syntactics; Tensors; Categorical model; Distributional compositional categorical; Language model; Language processing; Learning patterns; Model-based OPC; Natural languages; Neural-networks; QNLP; Text representation; Quantum computers,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62201525, 61972050); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (CUC24QT08)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62201525, 61972050), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (CUC24QT08).","Lipton Z.C., Berkowitz J., Elkan C., A critica l re- view of recurrent neura l networks for sequence lea rning, (2015); Li Z., Liu F., Yang W., Peng S., Zhou J., A survey of convolutional neura l networks: A na lysis, a pplica tions, a nd prospects, IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems, 33, 12, pp. 6999-7019, (2021); Vaswani A., Shazeer N., Parmar N., Uszkoreit J., Jones L., Gomez A.N., Kaiser L., Polosukhin I., Attention is a ll you need, Advances in neural information processing systems, 30, (2017); Coecke B., Sadrzadeh M., Clark S., Ma thematica l foundations for a compositional distributional model of mea ning, (2010); Rieser H.-M., Koster F., Raulf A.P., Tensor networks or qua ntum ma chine lea rning, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, 479, 2275, (2023); Coecke B., De Felice G., Meichanetzidis K., Toumi A., Founda tions for near-term qua ntum na tura l la ngua ge processing, (2020); Mikolov T., Chen K., Corrado G., Dean J., Efficient estima tion of word representa tions in vector spa ce, (2013); Pennington J., Socher R., Manning C.D., Glove: Globa l vectors for word representa tion, Proceedings of the 2014 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing (EMNLP, 2014, pp. 1532-1543; Peters M.E., Neumann M., Iyyer M., Gardner M., Clark C., Lee K., Zettlemoyer L., Deep contextua lized word representa tions, Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, 1, pp. 2227-2237, (2018); Kenton J.D.M.-W.C., Touta Nova L.K., Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectiona l tra nsformers for la ngua ge understa nding, Proceedings of NAACL-HLT, pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Arora S., Liang Y., Ma T., A simple but tough -to- beat baseline for sentence embeddings, International conference on learning representations, 2016, pp. 1367-1377, (2017); Hill F., Cho K., Korhonen A., Learning distributed representations of sentences from unlabeled da ta, 15th Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, NAACL HLT, pp. 1367-1377, (2016); Kiros J., Chan W., InferLite: Simple universal sentence representa tions from na tura l la ngua ge inference da ta, Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2018, pp. 4868-4874; Lorenz R., Pearson A., Meichanetzidis K., Kartsaklis D., Coecke B., Qnlp in pra ctice: Running compositiona l models of mea ning on a qua ntum computer, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 76, pp. 1305-1342, (2023); Sordoni A., Nie J.-Y., Bengio Y., Modeling term dependencies with quantum language models for IR, Proceedings of the 36th international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval, pp. 653-662, (2013)","T.

This paper explores the integration of quantum computing and natural language processing (NLP) to enhance cyber threat analysis. Traditional computing methods struggle to keep up with the scale and complexity of modern cyber threats, but quantum computing offers a promising avenue for accelerated data processing, while NLP provides sophisticated tools for interpreting and understanding human language, crucial for analysing threat intelligence. Our proposed framework leverages quantum algorithms for rapid anomaly detection and advanced NLP techniques for precise threat identification and analysis. The methodology includes data collection from diverse sources, pre-processing for normalization, quantum-assisted data processing using Grover's search and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), NLP analysis with transformers and BERT-based models, and integration of findings to build comprehensive threat profiles. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements: quantum algorithms reduced data processing time by up to 50%, NLP models achieved 92% accuracy in threat identification, and the false positive rate was reduced by 30%. These findings indicate a promising direction for next-generation cybersecurity solutions, enabling more proactive and efficient threat mitigation. Future work will focus on refining quantum algorithms, enhancing NLP models, and expanding the framework for real-time threat detection capabilities. © 2024, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG).

Therefore, a novel end-to-end quantum machine learning approach using multiple data modalities for the identification of diagnoses, prognoses, and effective treatments is proposed. In a procedural flow, data is sourced from one or more of the following: CT scan images, webcam, patient-physician audio, Whole Slide Images, and clinical data. For image data, a Convolutional Neural Network, is employed to detect high level features. With text-based clinical data (including audio-derived data), a Bidirectional Encoder Representation model is used to extract text embeddings. For video data, pupil progression and average fixation duration features are manually crafted. All feature vectors are concatenated, normalized, passed through a Deep Neural Network, and then mapped to one of 38 neurodegenerative and cancerous diseases. For prognosis, features are pooled, concatenated with the diagnosis feature vector, and passed through another neural network with an output of survival times. Treatment prediction involves an information-retrieval task matching feature vectors to treatments/drug lists from the FDA. The proposed approach was tested on 5,000 patient profiles sourced from the public TCGA and JPND databases, outperforming all other state-of-the-art approaches. The model predicted diagnoses with an accuracy of 98.53%, achieved a Concordance Index of 0.94 in predicting prognoses, and in treatment prediction achieved a 99.32% accuracy. © 2022 IEEE.",BERT; diagnosis; Machine Learning; neurodegenerative diseases; pan cancer; prognosis,Computerized tomography; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Forecasting; Learning systems; Medical imaging; BERT; Clinical data; Features vector; Image data; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Multi-modal; Neurodegenerative; Pan cancer; Prognose; Neurodegenerative diseases,,,,,,,"(2021); Promoting Cancer Early Diagnosis; Disparities in Access to Cancer Care, American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, (2020); Stanford Health Care, (2014); Brown T., Mann B., Ryder N., Subbiah M., Kaplan J.D., Dhariwal P., Neelakantan A., Et al., Language models are few-shot learners, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, pp. 1877-1901, (2020); Cong I., Et al., Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks, Nature Physics, 15, 12, pp. 1273-1278, (2019); Devlin J., Et al., BERT: Pre-Training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding., (2018); Khattab O., Zaharia M., ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT., (2020); Katzman J.L., Et al., DeepSurv: Personalized Treatment Recommender System Using a Cox Proportional Hazards Deep Neural Network, BMC Medical Research Methodology, 18, 1, (2018); Kingma D.P., Ba J., Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization., (2014); Srivastava N., Et al., Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 15, pp. 1929-1958, (2014); Yao L., Et al., KG-BERT: BERT for Knowledge Graph Completion; Campbell J.D., Et al., Genomic, Pathway Network, and Immunologic Features Distinguishing Squamous Carcinomas, Cell reports, 23, 1, pp. 194-212, (2018); Berg A., Deng J., Fei-Fei L., Large scale visual recognition challenge 2010, (2010); Simard P.Y., Steinkraus D., Platt J.C., Best practices forconvolutional neural networks applied to visual document analysis, Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, 2, pp. 958-962, (2003); Bajaj P., Et al., MS MARCO: A Human Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset., (2018); Boteva V., Gholipour D., Sokolov A., Riezler S., A Full-Text Learning to Rank Dataset for Medical Information Retrieval, Proceedings of the 38th European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR), (2016)","S.

Existing methods mainly combine the dependency tree to deep learning with complex computation time to achieve enough semantic information. It is essential to obtain sufficient semantic information and syntactic structures without any prior knowledge excepting word2vec. This paper proposes a model on sentence representation inspired by quantum entanglement using the tensor product to entangle both two consecutive notional words and words with depen-dencies. Inspired by quantum entanglement coefficients, we construct two different entanglement coefficients to weight the different semantic contributions of words with different relations. Finally, the proposed model is applied to SICK_train to verify their performances.

We propose here a photonic miltiqubit controlled NOT gate based on a multi-wave mixing process in a cavity. Theory of such a multiqubit gate is constructed using input-output formalism. Parameters matching condition is found that must be fulfilled for successful gate operation. Recommendations are given for the construction of quantum neural networks that are able to solve various practical problems of natural language processing. © 2019 SPIE.,artificial intelligence; controlled NOT gates; multi-wave mixing; natural language processing,Artificial intelligence; Mixing; Nanoelectronics; Qubits; Controlled-NOT gates; Matching condition; Multi-wave-mixing; Multiqubit gates; NAtural language processing; Natural languages; Practical problems; Quantum neural networks; Natural language processing systems,,,,,,,"Young T., Hazarika D., Poria S., Cambria E., Recent Trends in Deep Learning Based Natural Language Processing, (2017); Aycinena M., Kochenderfer M.J., Mulford D.C., An Evolutionary Approach to Natural Grammar Induction; Lempa P., Ptaszynski M., Masui F., A survey on the use of genetic algorithms in natural language processing, The Association for Natural Language Processing, 39, (2016); Bungum L., Gamback B., Evolutionary algorithms in natural language processing, Norwegian Artificial Intelligence Symposium, 22, (2010); Bengio Y., Ducharme R., Vincent P., Jauvin C., A neural probabilistic language model, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 1137-1155, (2003); Chen H., Machine learning for information retrieval: Neural networks, symbolic learning, genetic algorithms, Journal of American Society for Information Science, 46, 3, pp. 194-216, (1995); Davila J.J., Genetic algorithm and the evolution of neural networks for language processing, CELETwenty Workshop on Language Processing, (2000); Kearney W.T., Using Genetic Algorithms to Evolve Artificial Neural Networks, 818, (2016); Next Generation Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning; Rei M., Kochmar E., Constructing and evaluating word embeddings, Computer Laboratory University of Cambridge; Schuld M., Sinayskiy I., Petruccione F., The Quest for A Quantum Neural Network, (2014); More Sh., Dhir G.S., Daiwadney D., Dhir R.S., Review on language translator using quantum neural network (QNN, International Journal of Engineering and Techniques, 2, 1, pp. 71-74, (2016); Narayan R., Singh V.P., Chakraverty S., Quantum Neural Network Based Machine Translator for Hindi to English, The Scientific World Journal, 2014, (2014); Matsui N., Kouda N., Nishimura H., Neural networks based on QBP and its performance, Proceedings of the IEEE-INNS-ENNS International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 3, pp. 247-252, (2000); Li J., Quantum-inspired neural networks with application, Open Journal of Applied Sciences, 5, pp. 233-239, (2015); Li P.C., Li S.Y., Learning algorithm and application of quantum BP neural networks based on universal quantum gates, Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics, 19, 1, pp. 167-174, (2008); Cao M., Li P., Quantum-inspired Neural Networks with Applications, International Journal of Computer and Information Technology, 3, 1, pp. 83-92, (2014); Li J., Zhao S., Neural networks based on quantum gated nodes, International Journal of Computer and Information Technology, 4, 3, pp. 583-589, (2015); Li P., Ya Z., Model and algorithm of sequence-based quantum-inspired neural networks, Chinese Journal of Electronics, 27, 1, pp. 9-18, (2018); Waseem M., Irfan M., Sh Q., Realization of quantum gates with multiple control qubits or multiple target qubits in a cavity, Quantum Information Processing, 14, 6, pp. 1869-1887, (2015); Zhou Y.-H., Shao X.-Q., Yang C.-J., Zhang S., Implementation of non-local multi-qubit CNOT Operation with Multi-Qubit GHz States, Journal of the Korean Physical Society, 53, 2, pp. 477-480, (2008); Isenhower L., Saffman M., Molmer K., Multibit CkNOT quantum gates via Rydberg blockade, Quantum Information Processing, 10, (2011); Li W.-A., Chen Y., Simplified Proposal for Realizing Multiqubit Tunable Phase Gate in Circuit QED; Waseem M., Irfan M., Qamar S., Multiqubit Quantum Phase Gate Using Four-level Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices Coupled to Superconducting Resonator; Zhang J., Liu W., Deng Zh., Lu Zh., Long G.L., Modularization of the Multi-qubit Controlled Phase Gate and Its NMR Implementation; Pei-Min L., Jie S., Yan X., Implementing a multi-qubit quantum phase gate encoded by photonic qubit, Chin.

A quantum neural network has been proven to solve the memory bottleneck problem of classical machine learning, so it has far-reaching prospects in the field of vulnerability detection. To fill the gap in this field, we propose a quantum neural network structure named QDENN for software vulnerability detection. This work is the first attempt to implement word embedding of vulnerability codes based on a quantum neural network, which proves the feasibility of a quantum neural network in the field of vulnerability detection. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed QDENN can effectively solve the inconsistent input length problem of quantum neural networks and the problem of batch processing with long sentences. Furthermore, it can give full play to the advantages of quantum computing and realize a vulnerability detection model at the cost of a small amount of measurement. Compared to other quantum neural networks, our proposed QDENN can achieve higher vulnerability detection accuracy. On the sub dataset with a small-scale interval, the model accuracy rate reaches 99%. On each subinterval data, the best average vulnerability detection accuracy of the model reaches 86.3%. © 2022, The Author(s).",,article; embedding; feasibility study; machine learning; software; vulnerability,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61802433, 61802435); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The funding was provided by Natural Science Foundation of China (61802433, 61802435).

Previous results have achieved perfect accuracy on an artificial dataset of 100 short sentences, but at the unscalable cost of using a qubit for each word. This paper demonstrates that an amplitude encoded feature map combined with a quantum support vector machine can achieve 62% average accuracy predicting sentiment using a dataset of 50 actual movie reviews.

The language-modelling framework we employ is that of compositional distributional semantics (DisCoCat), which extends and complements the compositional structure of pregroup grammars. Within this model, the grammatical reduction of a sentence is interpreted as a diagram, encoding a specific interaction of words according to the grammar. It is this interaction which, together with a specific choice of word embedding, realises the meaning (or”semantics”) of a sentence. Building on the formal quantum-like nature of such interactions, we present a method for mapping DisCoCat diagrams to quantum circuits. Our methodology is compatible both with NISQ devices and with established Quantum Machine Learning techniques, paving the way to near-term applications of quantum technology to natural language processing. © K.

They, nonetheless, pose a key challenge to the development of competent machines to understand natural language and use it as humans do. Contextuality is an unparalleled phenomenon in quantum mechanics, where different mathematical formalisms have been put forwards to understand and reason about it. In this paper, we construct a schema for anaphoric ambiguities that exhibits quantum-like contextuality. We use a recently developed criterion of sheaf-theoretic contextuality that is applicable to signalling models. We then take advantage of the neural word embedding engine BERT to instantiate the schema to natural language examples and extract probability distributions for the instances. As a result, plenty of sheaf-contextual examples were discovered in the natural language corpora BERT utilises. Our hope is that these examples will pave the way for future research and for finding ways to extend applications of quantum computing to natural language processing. © K. I. Lo, M. Sadrzadeh & S.

The main challenges consist in finding the most adequate ways of encoding words and their interactions on a quantum computer, considering hardware constraints, as well as building algorithms that take advantage of quantum architectures, so as to show improvement on the performance of natural language tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that starts from a grammar that can be interpreted by means of tensor contraction, to build word representations as quantum states that serve as input to a quantum algorithm. We start by introducing an operator measurement to contract the representations of words, resulting in the representation of larger fragments of text. We then go on to develop pipelines for the tasks of sentence meaning disambiguation and question answering that take advantage of quantum features. For the first task, we show that our contraction scheme deals with syntactically ambiguous phrases storing the various different meanings in quantum superposition, a solution not available on a classical setting. For the second task, we obtain a question representation that contains all possible answers in equal quantum superposition, and we implement Grover’s quantum search algorithm to find the correct answer, agnostic to the specific question, an implementation with the potential of delivering a result with quadratic speedup. © 2022, The Author(s).",Grover’s algorithm; Quantum natural language processing; Quantum search; Question answering; Syntactic ambiguities,Computer hardware; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Text processing; Automatic text processing; Grov’s algorithm; Hardware constraints; Quanta computers; Quantum natural language processing; Quantum search; Quantum superpositions; Question Answering; S-algorithms; Syntactic Ambiguities; Natural language processing systems,,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO; Ministerie van Onderwijs, Cultuur en Wetenschap, OCW; Universiteit Utrecht, UU; UK Research and Innovation, UKRI, (106170)","We would like to thank the anonymous referees for the helpful comments.

The KNN algorithm is a widely used text classification algorithm, because it is simple, valid and non-parameters. The main idea of KNN algorithm is to calculate the similarity between the new sample with unknown class label and the training samples, and choosing the class label of the highest k nearest neighbors as the new sample's class label. However, the text contains hundreds and thousands of features. The similarity computing in large numbers of vector will cost many time. In fact that, many machine learning algorithms are unable to manipulate and compute large number of vectors in high-dimensional space. Quantum computing algorithms are good at computing high-dimensional vectors in large tensor product spaces. It can provide exponential speed-up over its classical counterparts. The N-dimensional quantum vectors represent 2N quantum superposition states. The similarity computing on the N-dimensional vectors is also on the 2N quantum superposition states simultaneously. Therefore, this paper introduces a KNN algorithms based on quantum computing, which uses fidelity to compute the similarity between two quantum states. The Control-Swap Test gate is very convenient as a fidelity estimator. © 2015 IEEE.",KNN; machine learning; Quantum information; text classification,Character recognition; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Quantum computers; Quantum optics; Text processing; Vector spaces; Vectors; Classical counterpart; Dimensional vectors; High dimensional spaces; K-nearest neighbors; Quantum Information; Quantum superposition state; Similarity computing; Text classification; Classification (of information),,,,,,,"Esma A., Gilles B., Sebastien G., Machine Learning in A Quantum World, pp. 431-442, (2006); Nathan W., Ashish K., Krysta M.S., Quantum Algorithms for Nearest-Neighbor Methods for Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, (2014); Feynman R.P., Simulating physics with computers, International Journal of Theoretical Physics, 21, 6-7, pp. 467-488, (1982); Grover L.K., Quantum mechanism helps in searching for a needle in a haystack, Physical Revies Letters, 79, pp. 325-328, (1997); Shor P.W., Polynomial-Time algorithm for prime factorization and discrete logarithms on a quantum computer, SIAM Journal on Computation, 26, 5, pp. 1484-1509, (1997); Cai X.D., Wu D., Su Z.E., Et al., Entanglement-Based Machine Learning on A Quantum Computer, (2015); Seth L., Masoud M., Patrick R., Quantum Algorithm for Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning, (2013); Peishu X., Quantum computing, Journal of Computer Research & Development, 38, 10, pp. 1153-1171, (2001); Lijuan G., Xingyi L., Improvements of KNN algorithm for Big Data Classification, Applicatiion Research of Computers, 31, 5, pp. 1342-1344, (2014); Paul I.H., Ioannis G.K., Quantum Computers: Registers, gates and algorithms, Proc. 28th International Conference on Microelectronics (MIEL), 2012, pp. 15-21, (2012); Kristen L.P., Daniel A.L., Quantum Adiabatic Machine Learning, (2011); Yi Z., Kai L., Yinghui G., Quantum algorithms and Quantum-Inspired algorithms, Chinese Journal of Computers, 36, 9, pp. 1835-1842, (2013); Shuhao W., Guilu L., Big data and quantum computing, Computer China Press, 60, 56, pp. 499-508, (2015); Patrick R., Masoud M., Seth L., Quantum Support Vector Machine for Big Feature and Big Data Classification, (2013)",,Xiao Z.; Tong Z.; Li K.; Wang X.; Li K.,IEEE Computer Society,,"11th International Conference on Natural Computation, ICNC 2015",15 August 2015 through 17 August 2015,Zhangjiajie,118970.0,21579555,978-146737679-2,,,English,Proc.

We studied the performance of the two most popular optimizers and compared their results with some popular classical machine learning algorithms. The classical algorithms we used in our study are support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting (GB) and random forest (RF). These were compared with a variational quantum classifier (VQC) using two sets of local optimizers viz AQGD and COBYLA. For experimenting with VQC, IBM Quantum Experience and IBM Qiskit was used while for classical machine learning models, scikit-learn was used. The results show that machine learning on noisy immediate scale quantum machines can produce comparable results as on classical machines. For our experiments, we have used a popular restaurant sentiment analysis dataset. The extracted features from this dataset and then after applying PCA reduced the feature set into 5 features. Quantum ML models were trained using 100 epochs and 150 epochs on using EfficientSU2 variational circuit. Overall, four Quantum ML models were trained and three Classical ML models were trained. The performance of the trained models was evaluated using standard evaluation measures viz, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-Score. In all the cases AQGD optimizer-based model with 100 Epochs performed better than all other models. It produced an accuracy of 77% and an F-Score of 0.785 which were highest across all the trained models.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Decision trees; Intelligent computing; Learning algorithms; Sentiment analysis; Support vector machines; F-score; Feature sets; Gradient boosting; Local optimizers; Machine learning models; Optimizers; Quantum machines; Standard evaluations; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Aiimeur E., Brassard G., Gambs S., In Conference of the Canadian Society for Computational Studies of Intelligence, (2006); Kak S.

It has been particularly successful in quantum computing and natural language processing recently; traditionally, it has played major rôles in compositional semantics of programming languages and symbolic reasoning systems. Building upon them, we propose the mathematical system of neural string diagrams as a universal modelling language for categorical deep learning, which allows us to turn informal neural network architecture pictures into formally explainable, mathematically verifiable, and systematically composable entities in their own right. We give, in particular, a neural string diagram account of CNN and Transformer (which has never been achieved before). Neural string diagrams can be computed with DisCoPy, Quantomatic, and their extensions. Categorically formalised neural networks can be instantiated for both ordinary vector spaces and other monoidal categorical structures, allowing for generalisations of deep learning (e.g., deep learning on relational structures, deep learning on graph and other network structures, etc.). We envisage that the category theory approach to artificial intelligence ultimately contributes to the development of artificial general intelligence, giving a universal modelling language for intelligent systems and agents. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Categorical artificial intelligence; Categorical deep learning; Neural category theory,Computation theory; Deep learning; Intelligent systems; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Quantum computers; Vector spaces; Categorical artificial intelligence; Categorical deep learning; Category theory; Compositional models; Computational system; Logical physicals; Logical system; Neural category theory; Physical systems; Universal modeling languages; Semantics,,,,,"Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST, (JPMJMS2033, JPMJPR17G9)",This work was supported by JST (JPMJMS2033; JPMJPR17G9).,"Abramsky S., Coecke B., Categorical quantum mechanics, Handbook of Quantum Logic and Quantum Structures, pp. 261-325, (2009); Besold T., Et al., Neural-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning, (2017); Clark S., Et al., Mathematical foundations for a compositional distributional model of meaning, Linguist.

We systematically analyze RNNs' behaviors in a ubiquitous NLP task, the sentiment analysis of movie reviews, via the mapping between a class of RNNs called recurrent arithmetic circuits (RACs) and a matrix product state. Using the von-Neumann entanglement entropy (EE) as a proxy for information propagation, we show that single-layer RACs possess a maximum information propagation capacity, reflected by the saturation of the EE. Enlarging the bond dimension beyond the EE saturation threshold does not increase model prediction accuracies, so a minimal model that best estimates the data statistics can be inferred. Although the saturated EE is smaller than the maximum EE allowed by the area law, our minimal model still achieves 1/499% training accuracies in realistic sentiment analysis data sets. Thus, low EE is not a warrant against the adoption of single-layer RACs for NLP. Contrary to a common belief that long-range information propagation is the main source of RNNs' successes, we show that single-layer RACs harness high expressiveness from the subtle interplay between the information propagation and the word vector embeddings. Our work sheds light on the phenomenology of learning in RACs, and more generally on the explainability of RNNs for NLP, using tools from many-body quantum physics.  © 2022 The Author(s).

In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical model of LSTM, which we dub QLSTM. We demonstrate that the proposed model successfully learns several kinds of temporal data. In particular, we show that for certain testing cases, this quantum version of LSTM converges faster, or equivalently, reaches a better accuracy, than its classical counterpart. Due to the variational nature of our approach, the requirements on qubit counts and circuit depth are eased, and our work thus paves the way toward implementing machine learning algorithms for sequence modeling such as natural language processing, speech recognition on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. © 2022 IEEE",Long short-term memory;

Here, popular machine learning algorithms viz support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting (GB) and random forest (RF) are compared with variational quantum classifier (VQC) using two sets of parameterized circuits viz EfficientSU2 and RealAmplitudes. For experimenting with VQC, IBM Quantum Experience and IBM Qiskit were used while for classical machine learning models, scikit-learn was used. It was found that the performance of the VQC was slightly better than popular machine learning algorithms. For our experiments, we have used popular restaurant sentiment analysis dataset. The extracted features from this dataset and then after applying PCA reduced the feature set into 5 features. Quantum ML models were trained using 100 epochs and 150 epochs. Overall, four Quantum ML models were trained and three Classical ML models were trained. The performance of the trained models was evaluated using standard evaluation measures viz, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-Score etc. In all the cases EfficientSU2 based model with 100 Epochs performed better than all other models. Efficient SU2 model with 100 epochs produced an accuracy of 74.5% and an F-Score of 0.7605 which were highest across all the trained models. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Sentiment analysis; Support vector machines; Timing circuits; F-score; Feature sets; Gradient boosting; Machine learning models; Parameterized; Quantum machines; Standard evaluations; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Kak S.

In this paper we study a quantum reservoir computer (QRC), a framework harnessing quantum dynamics and designed for fast and efficient solving of temporal machine learning tasks such as speech recognition, time series prediction and natural language processing. Specifically, we study memory capacity and accuracy of a quantum reservoir computer based on the fully connected transverse field Ising model by investigating different forms of inter-spin interactions and computing timescales. We show that variation in inter-spin interactions leads to a better memory capacity in general, by engineering the type of interactions the capacity can be greatly enhanced and there exists an optimal timescale at which the capacity is maximized. To connect computational capabilities to physical properties of the underlaying system, we also study the out-of-time-ordered correlator and find that its faster decay implies a more accurate memory. Furthermore, as an example application on real world data, we use QRC to predict stock values. © 2020, The Author(s).",,article; human; machine learning; memory; natural language processing; prediction; speech discrimination; time series analysis,,,,,"Jenny ja Antti Wihurin Rahasto; Council of Finnish Foundations; Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology, PRESTO, (JPMJPR1668); Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology, PRESTO; Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, CREST, (JPMJCR1673); Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, CREST; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (19H05796, JP16H02211); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN; Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology, ERATO, (JPMJER1601); Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology, ERATO","A.K. is supported by Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation through Council of Finnish Foundations\u2019 Post Doc Pool, T.S. by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP16H02211 and JP19H05796, and K.F. by JST PRESTO Grant Number JPMJPR1668, JST ERATO Grant Number JPMJER1601, and JST CREST Grant Number JPMJCR1673.

This assumption is at the basis of our study. The tools are 1) identifying new parameters for the production of fixed structures identified in the Planat model mathematical theories; 2) using Charles Baudelaire’s narrative text [3] to clarify the importance of the verb in the sentence through the research and experimentation method into a local grammar; 3) utilizing Max Silberztein's NooJ system [4], for the production of sentence analysis and paraphrases, tools for developing formal dictionaries and grammars, and NLP applications such as semantic annotators; 4) developing the implementation of advanced integrated Machine Learning algorithms for the creation of knowledge from obtained data; 5) applying the BuViTeMS (© 2020) AW Digital Intelligence model for the production of edited, reformulated and translated sentences using a mixed system.

Moreover, the field of natural language processing (NLP) is rapidly attracting researchers and engineers in order to build larger model computations of NLP. Thus, the use of quantum technology in NLP tasks, especially sentiment classification, has the potential to be developed. In this research, we investigate the best technique to represent sentiment sentences so that sentiment can be analyzed using the Quantum-Enhanced Support Vector Machine (QE-SVM) algorithm. Investigations were carried out using circuit parameter optimization methods and data transformation. The pipeline of the proposed method consists of sentence-to-circuit conversion, circuit parameter training, state vector formation, and finally the training and testing processes. As a result, we obtained the best classification results with an accuracy of 93.33% using the SPSA optimization method and PCA transformation data. These results have also outperformed the baseline SVM method.  © 2013 IEEE.",quantum representation; quantum-enhanced; Sentiment classification; SVM,Job analysis; Metadata; Optimization; Quantum computers; Support vector machines; Vectors; Kernel; Quantum Computing; Quantum representation; Quantum-enhanced; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Support vectors machine; SVM; Task analysis; Sentiment analysis,,,,,,,"Liu B., Sentiment Analysis: Mining Opinions, Sentiments, and Emotions; Vyas V., Uma V., Approaches to sentiment analysis on product reviews, Sentiment Analysis and Knowledge Discovery in Contemporary Business, pp. 15-30, (2019); Unankard S., Li X., Sharaf M., Zhong J., Li X., Predicting elections from social networks based on sub-event detection and sentiment analysis, Proc. 15th Int.

Reservoir computing is an efficient learning paradigm that utilizes nonlinear dynamical systems for temporal information processing, i.e., processing of input sequences to produce output sequences. Here we propose quantum reservoir computing that harnesses complex dissipative quantum dynamics. Our class of quantum reservoirs is universal, in that any nonlinear fading memory map can be approximated arbitrarily closely and uniformly over all inputs by a quantum reservoir from this class. We describe a subclass of the universal class that is readily implementable using quantum gates native to current noisy gate-model quantum computers. Proof-of-principle experiments on remotely accessed cloud-based superconducting quantum computers demonstrate that small and noisy quantum reservoirs can tackle high-order nonlinear temporal tasks. Our theoretical and experimental results pave the path for attractive temporal processing applications of near-term gate-model quantum computers of increasing fidelity but without quantum error correction, signifying the potential of these devices for wider applications including neural modeling, speech recognition, and natural language processing, going beyond static classification and regression tasks. © 2020 American Physical Society.",,Dynamical systems; Error correction; Learning systems; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Nonlinear dynamical systems; Quantum theory; Qubits; Speech recognition; Dissipative quantum dynamics; NAtural language processing; Proof-of-principle experiments; Quantum error corrections; Reservoir Computing; Static classification; Temporal information processing; Temporal processing; Computer circuits,,,,,"Keisuke Fujii; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Monbusho, (JPMXS0118067285); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Monbusho",The authors thank Keisuke Fujii for an insightful discussion.

Although the phenomenon is new, it has already proved its worth in various fields like finance and chemistry. The potential of quantum computing and its extraordinary properties enable us to process data in a way classical computer can never think of. When machine learning gets the power of quantum computing, information processing is enhanced significantly. In this paper, we have used variational quantum classifiers to classify questions from two domains of SelQA dataset. We keep the focus on the implications of circuit-depth in different experiments and analyze the results.

We propose a protocol based on quantum long short-term memory (Q-LSTM) for Q-NLP to perform various tasks in general but specifically for translating a sentence from English to Persian. Then, we generalize our method to use quantum circuits of sentences as an input for the Q-LSTM cell. This enables us to translate sentences in different languages.

Ongoing work in this field attempts to incorporate grammatical structure into algorithms that compute meaning. In [5, 7], Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark introduce such a model (the CSC model) based on tensor product composition. While this algorithm has many advantages, its implementation is hampered by the large classical computational resources that it requires. In this work we show how computational shortcomings of the CSC approach could be resolved using quantum computation (possibly in addition to existing techniques for dimension reduction). We address the value of quantum RAM [8] for this model and extend an algorithm from Wiebe, Braun and Lloyd [24] into a quantum algorithm to categorize sentences in CSC. Our new algorithm demonstrates a quadratic speedup over classical methods under certain conditions. ï¿½ W. Zeng & B.

We witness its power in various domains such as banking, business, and the marketing industry. We already know how classical AI and machine learning can change and improve technology. Quantum natural language processing (QNLP) is a young and gradually emerging technology that can provide a quantum advantage for NLP tasks. In this paper, we show the first application of QNLP for sentiment analysis and achieve perfect test set accuracy for three different kinds of simulations and decent accuracy for experiments run on a noisy quantum device. We utilize the lambeq QNLP toolkit and t|ket > by Cambridge Quantum (Quantinuum) to produce the results.  © 2022 IEEE.",lambeq; Quantum Computing; Quantum Natural Language Processing,Learning algorithms; Quantum computers; Technology transfer; Emerging technologies; Lambeq; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Power; Quantinuum computing; Quantinuum natural language processing; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment classification; Sentiment analysis,,,,,,,"Preskill J., Quantum computing in the nisq era and beyond, Quantum, 2, (2018); Coecke B., Horsman D., Kissinger A., Wang Q., Kindergarden quantum mechanics graduates (..or how i learned to stop gluing lego together and love the zx-calculus), 2021; Coecke B., Kissinger A., Picturing Quantum Processes: A First Course in Quantum Theory and Diagrammatic Reasoning.

At the same time, quantum computers have become much more powerful, and announcements of major advances are frequently in the news. The mathematical techniques underlying both these areas have more in common than is sometimes realized. Vector spaces took a position at the axiomatic heart of quantum mechanics in the 1930s, and this adoption was a key motivation for the derivation of logic and probability from the linear geometry of vector spaces. Quantum interactions between particles are modelled using the tensor product, which is also used to express objects and operations in artificial neural networks. This paper describes some of these common mathematical areas, including examples of how they are used in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in automated reasoning and natural language processing (NLP). Techniques discussed include vector spaces, scalar products, subspaces and implication, orthogonal projection and negation, dual vectors, density matrices, positive operators, and tensor products. Application areas include information retrieval, categorization and implication, modelling word-senses and disambiguation, inference in knowledge bases, decision making, and semantic composition. Some of these approaches can potentially be implemented on quantum hardware. Many of the practical steps in this implementation are in early stages, and some are already realized. Explaining some of the common mathematical tools can help researchers in both AI and quantum computing further exploit these overlaps, recognizing and exploring new directions along the way. © 2021 AI Access Foundation.",,Computation theory; Decision making; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Quantum computers; Quantum theory; Semantics; Tensors; Vectors; Automated reasoning; Axiomatics; Computer science and technologies; Linear geometry; Logic and probability; Quanta computers; Quantum interactions; Tensor products; Time quantum; Vector space models; Vector spaces,,,,,,,"Aaronson S., Quantum computing since Democritus, (2013); Aaronson S., Read the fine print, Nature Physics, 11, 4, pp. 291-293, (2015); Abbas A., Sutter D., Zoufal C., Lucchi A., Figalli A., Woerner S., The power of quantum neural networks, Nature Computational Science, 1, 6, pp. 403-409, (2021); Abramsky S., Coecke B., A categorical semantics of quantum protocols, Proceedings of the 19th Annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science, pp. 415-425, (2004); Abramsky S., Coecke B., Categorical quantum mechanics, Handbook of quantum logic and quantum structures, 2, pp. 261-325, (2009); Aerts D., Czachor M., Quantum aspects of semantic analysis and symbolic artificial intelligence, J.

In this paper, we present results on the first NLP experiments conducted on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers for datasets of size greater than 100 sentences. Exploiting the formal similarity of the compositional model of meaning by Coecke, Sadrzadeh, and Clark (2010) with quantum theory, we create representations for sentences that have a natural mapping to quantum circuits. We use these representations to implement and successfully train NLP models that solve simple sentence classification tasks on quantum hardware. We conduct quantum simulations that compare the syntax-sensitive model of Coecke et al. with two baselines that use less or no syntax; specifically, we implement the quantum analogues of a “bag-of-words” model, where syntax is not taken into account at all, and of a word-sequence model, where only word order is respected. We demonstrate that all models converge smoothly both in simulations and when run on quantum hardware, and that the results are the expected ones based on the nature of the tasks and the datasets used. Another important goal of this paper is to describe in a way accessible to AI and NLP researchers the main principles, process and challenges of experiments on quantum hardware. Our aim in doing this is to take the first small steps in this unexplored research territory and pave the way for practical Quantum Natural Language Processing. ©2023 AI Access Foundation.

However, existing method requires the number of qubits is equal to the dimension of the word vectors, and may result in a surge of the qubit number. To address this problem, we propose a duplication-free quantum long short-term memory neural network (DQLSTM). Specifically, our DQLSTM adopts the amplitude encoding method to store the classical information, and further can reduce the requirement for the number of qubits. Our numerical results show that our DQLSTM has similar effectiveness to the classical counterpart in a Chinese sentiment analysis task, and outperforms several previous proposals in the same task.  © 2022 ACA.",Natural language processing; Quantum long short-term memory neural network; Quantum machine learning,Brain; Learning algorithms; Long short-term memory; Qubits; Sentiment analysis; Language processing; Machine-learning; Memory network; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Neural-networks; Quantum circuit; Quantum long short-term memory neural network; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Timing circuits,,,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFA0306703); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC","Xiaokai Hou and Yingli Yang contributed equally to this work.

This preliminary study investigates how sentiment can be represented correctly and efficiently for quantum natural language processing (QNLP). In particular, we present four possible approaches for representing sentiment words in the quantum case. We propose to utilize two quantum operations (i.e., X gate and Z-X gate), each with two different placements, to represent a negative sentence in a quantum circuit. Subsequently, we train the corresponding state vector using several classical classifiers: SVM, SPSA, and a combination of both, then evaluate the result in terms of accuracy. Experimental results show that the third approach, i.e., adding an X-gate at the end of the sentence outperforms other settings. Additionally, the third approach, along with the combined classifier of SVM and SPSA, reaches up to 81.67% accuracy. The proposed method can be helpful for applications of sentiment analysis in quantum computers.  © 2022 IEEE.",quantum representation; sentiment classification; SPSA; SVM,Optimization; Quantum computers;

Examples include Natural Language Processing (NLP) where sentence classification experiments have been carried out, as well as procedural generation, where tasks such as geopolitical map creation, and image manipulation have been performed. We explore applications at the intersection of these two areas by designing a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for sentence generation. Our algorithm is based on the well-known simulated annealing technique for combinatorial optimisation. An implementation is provided and used to demonstrate successful sentence generation on both simulated and real quantum hardware. A variant of our algorithm can also used for music generation.

The evolution of quantum computing hardware and simulators create avenues to design and develop NLP methods to test on these platforms. This research uses quantum natural language processing (QNLP) to simulate the sentence classification and compares optimization techniques (Simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation: SPSA and convergent optimization via most-promising-area stochastic search: COMPASS) for small dataset and simple sentence structures and the results are promising to show that with the COMPASS optimization technique the model performs better Table 1. When the ansatz depth is less and vice-versa. The research in quantum natural language processing is infancy, the simulation results are promising and the better results can be expected for large datasets with different sentence structures if real quantum computers are available in near future. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Binary Classification; COMPASS; DISCOCAT Model; Quantum Computing; Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP); SPSA,Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Optimization; Quantum computers; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Binary classification; COMPASSs; DISCOCAT model; Language processing; Natural languages; Optimization techniques; Quantum Computing; Quantum natural language processing; Sentence classifications; SPSA; Large dataset,,,,,"Royal Academy of Science London; Spanish Ministry; Uttar Pradesh; European Commission, EC; Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, DST; All India Council for Technical Education, अभातशिप; Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnológico Industrial, CDTI; Generalitat de Catalunya","Funding text 1: Dr. Jaume Anguera IEEE Fellow, founder and CTO at the technology company Ignion (Barcelona, Spain).

Every year, more and more software flaws are found, either internally in proprietary code or revealed publicly. These flaws are highly likely exploited and lead to system compromise, data leakage, or denial of service. C and C++ open-source codes are now available in order to create a large-scale, classical machine-learning and quantum machine-learning system for function-level vulnerability identification. We assembled a sizable dataset of millions of open-source functions that point to potential exploits. We created an efficient and scalable vulnerability detection method based on a deep neural network model– Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and quantum machine learning model– Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM), that can learn features extracted from the source codes. The source code is first converted into a minimal intermediate representation to remove the pointless components and shorten the dependency. Previous studies lack analyzing features of the source code that causes models to recognize flaws in real-life examples. Therefore, We keep the semantic and syntactic information using state-of-the-art word embedding algorithms such as Glove and fastText. The embedded vectors are subsequently fed into the classical and quantum convolutional neural networks to classify the possible vulnerabilities. To measure the performance, we used evaluation metrics such as F1 score, precision, recall, accuracy, and total execution time. We made a comparison between the results derived from the classical LSTM and quantum LSTM using basic feature representation as well as semantic and syntactic representation. We found that the QLSTM with semantic and syntactic features detects significantly accurate vulnerability and runs faster than its classical counterpart. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Classical machine learning; Cyber security; Feature extraction; Quantum natural language processing; Vulnerability detection,Brain; Cybersecurity; Deep neural networks; Denial-of-service attack; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Open source software; Open systems; Semantics; Syntactics; Classical machine learning; Cyber security; Features extraction; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Quantum machines; Quantum natural language processing; Source codes; Vulnerability detection; Long short-term memory,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (2100115); National Science Foundation, NSF","Acknowledgement.

In the last few years, several researchers have emerged in quantum computing in accordance with the artificial intelligence field. Natural language processing is one of the prominent subfields of artificial intelligence. Quantum computing can be applied to the applications of natural language processing for better performance. One of the vital applications of natural language processing is Parts-Of-Speech (POS) tagging. It is prerequired for many natural language processing applications. In this paper, we have performed POS tagging of the Mizo language using classical Long short-term memory (LSTM). Subsequently, quantum-enhanced long short-term memory (QLSTM) has also been used to perform POS tagging of the Mizo language. The approaches mentioned above have been tested on the Mizo-tagged corpus, and experimental results have shown that quantum computing approaches such as QLSTM need the inclusion of new technologies to achieve significant results.  © 2022 IEEE.",Natural language processing; POS tagging; Quantum computing; Quantum machine learning,Brain; Computational linguistics; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Quantum computers; Syntactics; Complex problems; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Part of speech tagging; Parts-of-speech tagging; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Long short-term memory,,,,,MeitY Quantum Computing Applications Lab,The work presented here falls under the Research Project Grant Ref.

This work proposes a vertical federated learning architecture based on variational quantum circuits to demonstrate the competitive performance of a quantum-enhanced pre-trained BERT model for text classification. In particular, our proposed hybrid classical-quantum model consists of a novel random quantum temporal convolution (QTC) learning framework replacing some layers in the BERT-based decoder. Our experiments on intent classification show that our proposed BERT-QTC model attains competitive experimental results in the Snips and ATIS spoken language datasets. Particularly, the BERT-QTC boosts the performance of the existing quantum circuit-based language model in two text classification datasets by 1.57% and 1.52% relative improvements. Furthermore, BERT-QTC can be feasibly deployed on both existing commercial-accessible quantum computation hardware and CPU-based interface for ensuring data isolation. © 2022 IEEE",heterogeneous computing; Quantum machine learning; spoken language understanding; temporal convolution; text classification,Classification (of information); Learning systems; Machine learning; Quantum computers; Text processing; Heterogeneous computing; Machine-learning; Quantum circuit; Quantum Computing; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Rich features; Spoken language understanding; Temporal convolution; Text classification; Convolution,,,,,,,"Stolcke A., Ries K., Coccaro N., Shriberg E., Bates R., Jurafsky D., Taylor P., Martin R., Ess-Dykema C.V., Meteer M., Dialogue act modeling for automatic tagging and recognition of conversational speech, Computational linguistics, 26, 3, pp. 339-373, (2000); Wang D., Brown G.J., Computational auditory scene analysis: Principles, algorithms, and applications, (2006); Wang Y.-Y., Deng L., Acero A., Spoken language understanding, IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 22, 5, pp. 16-31, (2005); Coucke A., Saade A., Ball A., Bluche T., Caulier A., Leroy D., Doumouro C., Gisselbrecht T., Caltagirone F., Lavril T., Et al., Snips voice platform: an embedded spoken language understanding system for private-by-design voice interfaces, (2018); Hemphill C.T., Godfrey J.J., Doddington G.R., The atis spoken language systems pilot corpus, Speech and Natural Language: Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Hidden Valley, (1990); Devlin J., Chang M.-W., Lee K., Toutanova K., Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Carlini N., Liu C., Erlingsson U., Kos J., Song D., The secret sharer: Evaluating and testing unintended memorization in neural networks, 28th {USENIX} Security Symposium ({USENIX} Security 19), pp. 267-284, (2019); Carlini N., Tramer F., Wallace E., Jagielski M., Herbert-Voss A., Lee K., Roberts A., Brown T., Song D., Erlingsson U., Et al., Extracting training data from large language models, (2020); Voigt P., Von dem Bussche A., The eu general data protection regulation (gdpr), A Practical Guide, (2017); Yang C.-H.H., Siniscalchi S.M., Lee C.-H., Pate-aae: Incorporating adversarial autoencoder into private aggregation of teacher ensembles for spoken command classification, Proc.
