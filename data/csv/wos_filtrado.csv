This is a hybrid field in which the potential of quantum mechanics is exploited and applied to critical aspects of language processing, involving different NLP tasks. Approaches developed so far span from those that demonstrate the quantum advantage only at the theoretical level to the ones implementing algorithms on quantum hardware. This paper aims to list the approaches developed so far, categorizing them by type, i.e., theoretical work and those implemented on classical or quantum hardware; by task, i.e., general purpose such as syntax-semantic representation or specific NLP tasks, like sentiment analysis or question answering; and by the resource used in the evaluation phase, i.e., whether a benchmark dataset or a custom one has been used. The advantages offered by QNLP are discussed, both in terms of performance and methodology, and some considerations about the possible usage QNLP approaches in the place of state-of-the-art deep learning-based ones are given.","[Guarasci, Raffaele; De Pietro, Giuseppe; Esposito, Massimo] Natl Res Council CNR, Inst High Performance Comp & Networking ICAR, I-80131 Naples, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Calcolo e Reti ad Alte Prestazioni (ICAR-CNR),"Esposito, M (corresponding author), Natl Res Council CNR, Inst High Performance Comp & Networking ICAR, I-80131 Naples, Italy.",raffaele.guarasci@icar.cnr.it; giuseppe.depietro@icar.cnr.it; massimo.esposito@icar.cnr.it,"Esposito, Massimo/AAX-3348-2020; De Pietro, Giuseppe/AAZ-1151-2020","de pietro, giuseppe/0000-0002-4675-5957; GUARASCI, RAFFAELE/0000-0002-0106-8635; ESPOSITO, MASSIMO/0000-0002-7196-7994",,,,,106,29,29,1,59,MDPI,BASEL,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Although some efforts based on syntactic analysis have opened the door to research in quantum NLP (QNLP), limitations such as heavy syntactic preprocessing and syntax-dependent network architecture make them impracticable on larger and real-world data sets. In this paper, we propose a new simple network architecture, called the quantum self-attention neural network (QSANN), which can compensate for these limitations. Specifically, we introduce the self-attention mechanism into quantum neural networks and then utilize a Gaussian projected quantum self-attention serving as a sensible quantum version of self-attention. As a result, QSANN is effective and scalable on larger data sets and has the desirable property of being implementable on near-term quantum devices. In particular, our QSANN outperforms the best existing QNLP model based on syntactic analysis as well as a simple classical self-attention neural network in numerical experiments of text classification tasks on public data sets. We further show that our method exhibits robustness to low-level quantum noises and showcases resilience to quantum neural network architectures.","[Li, Guangxi; Zhao, Xuanqiang; Wang, Xin] Baidu Res, Inst Quantum Comp, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Li, Guangxi] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Quantum Software & Informat, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Zhao, Xuanqiang] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Quantum Informat & Computat Initiat QICI, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xin] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol Guangzhou, Thrust Artificial Intelligence, Informat Hub, Guangzhou 511453, Peoples R China",Baidu; University of Technology Sydney; University of Hong Kong; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology (Guangzhou),"Wang, X (corresponding author), Baidu Res, Inst Quantum Comp, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.;Wang, X (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol Guangzhou, Thrust Artificial Intelligence, Informat Hub, Guangzhou 511453, Peoples R China.",felixxinwang@hkust-gz.edu.cn,"Wang, Xin/R-9850-2017; Zhao, Xuanqiang/NFT-9092-2025",,"Guangdong Provincial Quantum Science Strategic Initiative [GDZX2303007]; Quantum Science Center of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Baidu-UTS AI Meets Quantum project; China Scholarship Council [201806070139]; Australian Research Council Project [DP180100691, G0101000151]; Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology [2021ZD0302901]; Education Bureau of Guangzhou Municipality","Guangdong Provincial Quantum Science Strategic Initiative; Quantum Science Center of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Baidu-UTS AI Meets Quantum project; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Australian Research Council Project(Australian Research Council); Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology; Education Bureau of Guangzhou Municipality","This work was partially supported by Guangdong Provincial Quantum Science Strategic Initiative (Grant No. GDZX2303007).

The metrics we focus on are latency (i.e., the execution time), cost (i.e., a value of how expensive the query is in total), and cardinality (i.e., the number of rows in the result table). The critical link between QNLP and the database problem lies in using grammars, such as context-free grammar. Both natural language and SQL queries admit grammatical presentations, which allow us to develop a comprehensive framework for applying QNLP methods to solve the query estimation problem. The model comprises an encoding mechanism and a training phase, integrating classical and quantum subroutines. The encoding mechanism transforms SQL queries into parametrized quantum circuits as in QNLP. Classical optimization algorithms optimize the circuit parameters during training to predict query metrics. Comparing our model to the QNLP models, our model achieves accuracy comparable to the QNLP model in binary classification tasks. Additionally, we expand upon previous research by implementing multi-class classification tasks and comparing the cardinality estimation results to those of state-of-the-art databases. Our theoretical analysis of the quantum machine learning model includes calculations of its expressibility and entangling capabilities. The analysis reveals that the model possesses beneficial properties, making it suitable to be executed on near-term quantum hardware.","[Uotila, Valter] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Uotila, V (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.",valter.uotila@helsinki.fi,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,,,,,2024,,,,,,,392,393,,10.1109/QCE60285.2024.10321,0.0,,,2,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Quantum Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Physics,BY4DM,,,,,2025-08-16,WOS:001438832300169,0

The QNLP model training pipeline subsystem, which is fed with domain-rich KG data, runs on Quantum Circuits, accelerates the training process by effectively incorporating high-dimensional features to the deep layers of language models. Finally, the Information Retrieval subsystem is based on semantic data taxonomy, retrieving contextual data from the KG for the trained language models to be implemented on various distinctive use cases in the staffing and recruiting industry.

At the same time, in the area of quantum computing (QC), with the steady growth of quantum hardware and notable improvements towards implementations of quantum algorithms, we are approaching an era when quantum computers perform tasks that cannot be done on classical computers with a reasonable amount of resources. This provides an new range of opportunities for AI, and for NLP specifically. In this work, we work with the Categorical Distributional Compositional (DisCoCat) model of natural language meaning, whose underlying mathematical underpinnings make it amenable to quantum instantiations. Earlier work on fault-tolerant quantum algorithms has already demonstrated potential quantum advantage for NLP, notably employing DisCoCat. In this work, we focus on the capabilities of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware and perform the first implementation of an NLP task on a NISQ processor, using the DisCoCat framework. Sentences are instantiated as parameterised quantum circuits; word-meanings are embedded in quantum states using parameterised quantum-circuits and the sentence's grammatical structure faithfully manifests as a pattern of entangling operations which compose the word-circuits into a sentence-circuit. The circuits' parameters are trained using a classical optimiser in a supervised NLP task of binary classification.

In addition, we provide our results showing the efficacy of the method, and release our developed toolkit as an open software suite.","[O'Riordan, Lee J.; Doyle, Myles; Kannan, Venkatesh] Irish Ctr High End Comp, Dublin, Ireland; [O'Riordan, Lee J.; Doyle, Myles; Kannan, Venkatesh] Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland; [Baruffa, Fabio] Intel Deutschland GmbH, Feldkirchen, Germany",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Intel Corporation; Intel Germany,"O'Riordan, LJ (corresponding author), Irish Ctr High End Comp, Dublin, Ireland.;O'Riordan, LJ (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland.",lee.oriordan@ichec.ie,"O'Riordan, Lee/C-3627-2012; m, venkateshkannan/ADO-6347-2022","O'Riordan, Lee/0000-0002-6758-9433; Doyle, Myles/0000-0001-7889-8357;",Enterprise Ireland; European Union [IP 2018 0751]; Intel,Enterprise Ireland; European Union(European Union (EU)); Intel(Intel Corporation),"We would like to thank Prof. Bob Coecke and Dr Ross Duncan for discussions and suggestions during the early stages of this work.

Models like fastText [1], [2], GloVe [3], Numberbatch [4], or BERT [5] are common NLP embedding vectors or models that encode semantic properties of words or text fragments. We use these models to evaluate mapping properties and compression rate, as well as information preservation in quantum embeddings. For mapping embedding vectors to quantum states, we use encoding strategies, such as Amplitude Encoding. The encoding strategies allow us to map large dense vectors from the embedding models to compact quantum states using different compression ratios. The compression with Amplitude Encoding can be 2(n) to N, resulting in a mapping of a 1,024-dimensional vector of reals in the classical environment to a 10-qubit state. The goal of this work is to evaluate these strategies with respect to their compression ratio and measure the preservation of semantic information using similarity scores. We show that the resulting quantum embeddings based on mapped classical computing embeddings exhibit the same relational properties and that there is no significant loss of semantic information in the conversion from classical n-dimensional real vector embeddings to qubit states. We conclude that the experimental results allow us to quantum compute semantic similarities of words or text, reusing existing and freely available embedding models from classical NLP/AI computing.","[Cavar, Damir; Zhang, Chi] Indiana Univ Bloomington, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Cavar, D (corresponding author), Indiana Univ Bloomington, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",dcavar@iu.edu; czh4@iu.edu,,"Zhang, Chi/0009-0003-8429-974X",,,,,12,0,0,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,,,,,2024,,,,,,,450,451,,10.1109/QCE60285.2024.10350,0.0,,,2,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Quantum Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Physics,BY4DM,,,,,2025-08-16,WOS:001438832300198,0

Variational quantum circuits, where parameters of circuits are learned classically, have been widely used in many recent applications of QML. This is an instance of a hybrid quantum-classical framework, where both classical and quantum components are present. However, applying these techniques to applications involving massive data is a challenging task. One way to overcome this, is using the concept of classical-quantum transfer learning with the help of a dressed quantum circuit, introduced recently, where the underlying neural architecture is pre-trained classically, but at the final steps (decision layer), a quantum circuit is used, followed by quantum measurements and post-processing to classify images with high precision. In this paper, we applied hybrid classical-quantum transfer learning to another task of massive data processing, i.e., natural language processing (NLP). We show how to (binary) classify short texts (e.g., SMS) with classical-quantum transfer learning, which was originally applied to image processing only. Our quantum network uses pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers (BERT) model, and its variational quantum circuit is fine-tuned for text processing. We evaluated the performance of our hybrid neural architecture using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which is typically used in the evaluation of classification problems. The results indicate high precision as well as lower loss function. To our knowledge, our work is the first application of quantum transfer learning to the area of NLP. Finally, a comparison with a tool that uses learning but in a different way than transfer learning is presented.","[Ardeshir-Larijani, Ebrahim] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Math & Comp Sci, Tehran, Iran; [Nasiri Fatmehsari, Mohammad Mahdi] Pasargad Inst Adv Innovat Solut, Tehran, Iran",Iran University Science & Technology,"Ardeshir-Larijani, E (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Math & Comp Sci, Tehran, Iran.",larijani@iust.ac.ir; Mehdi.nafa1373@gmail.com,"ArdeshirLarijani, Ebrahim/KGL-5538-2024","Ardeshir-Larijani, Ebrahim/0000-0001-6432-2437",,,,,15,1,1,1,9,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2524-4906,2524-4914,,QUANT MACH INTELL,Quant.

An emergent application of Quantum Machine Intelligence (QMI) is Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP). This paper proposes a multi-dimensional, finite automaton model for quantum word embedding (QWE) via the Galois field. We demonstrated the model to three applications: (1) English vocabulary, (2) amino acid-based genetic codes, and (3) DNA-based genetic codes. The numerical results obtained from the proposed algorithm for the English vocabulary indicate that it produces more representative word features than Word2Vec based on the word distance metric. Second, the proposed algorithm is also utilized to model RNA-Protein interaction based on the latent distance of a given molecule, which is demonstrated on three large datasets, namely RPI369, RPI1807, and RPI2241. Finally, two embedding techniques for DNA-based genetic codes are proposed in this work: Two-state Lackadaisical Encoding (TCE) and Topological-Cyclic Encoding (TLE). These techniques enable extracting relevant features for the efficacy score of gRNAs used in the CRISPR-Cas 9 system, demonstrated on 15 datasets, compared to 12 mathematical features.

After we obtain satisfactory results, we test the resulting models with known datasets. Despite its promising results, quantum natural language processing is far from achieving its full potential. To achieve this potential, the quantum software and hardware must be improved to make them suitable for use with more extensive and complex datasets and other tasks.","[Peral-Garcia, David] Univ Salamanca, Fac Sci, Expert Syst & Applicat Lab ESALAB, Plaza Caidos s-n, Salamanca 37008, Spain; [Cruz-Benito, Juan] IBM TJ Watson Res Ctr, IBM Quantum, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA; [Garcia-Penalvo, Francisco Jose] Univ Salamanca, Res Inst Educ Sci, Dept Comp & Automat, GRIAL Res Grp, Paseo Canalejas 169, Salamanca 37008, Spain",University of Salamanca; International Business Machines (IBM); IBM USA; University of Salamanca,"Peral-García, D (corresponding author), Univ Salamanca, Fac Sci, Expert Syst & Applicat Lab ESALAB, Plaza Caidos s-n, Salamanca 37008, Spain.",daveral@usal.es; juan.cruz.benito@ibm.com; fgarcia@usal.es,"GARCIA-PENALVO, Francisco Jose/D-5445-2013; Cruz-Benito, Juan/C-5589-2014; GARCÍA-PEÑALVO, Francisco/D-5445-2013","GARCIA-PENALVO, Francisco Jose/0000-0001-9987-5584; Cruz-Benito, Juan/0000-0003-2045-8329;",,,"from lambeq import AtomicType, IQPAnsatz, remove_cups",,27,3,3,4,11,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0957-4174,1873-6793,,EXPERT SYST APPL,Expert Syst.

We focus on the recently proposed DisCoCirc framework for natural language, and propose a quantum adaptation, QDisCoCirc. This is motivated by a compositional approach to rendering AI interpretable: the behavior of the whole can be understood in terms of the behavior of parts, and the way they are put together. For the model-native primitive operation of text similarity, we derive quantum algorithms for fault-tolerant quantum computers to solve the task of question-answering within QDisCoCirc, and show that this is BQP-hard; note that we do not consider the complexity of question-answering in other natural language processing models. Assuming widely-held conjectures, implementing the proposed model classically would require super-polynomial resources. Therefore, it could provide a meaningful demonstration of the power of practical quantum processors. The model construction builds on previous work in compositional quantum natural language processing. Word embeddings are encoded as parameterized quantum circuits, and compositionality here means that the quantum circuits compose according to the linguistic structure of the text. We outline a method for evaluating the model on near-term quantum processors, and elsewhere we report on a recent implementation of this on quantum hardware. In addition, we adapt a quantum algorithm for the closest vector problem to obtain a Groverlike speedup in the fault-tolerant regime for our model. This provides an unconditional quadratic speedup over any classical algorithm in certain circumstances, which we will verify empirically in future work.","[Laakkonen, Tuomas; Meichanetzidis, Konstantinos; Coecke, Bob] Quantinuum, 17 Beaumont St, Oxford OX1 2NA, England",,"Laakkonen, T (corresponding author), Quantinuum, 17 Beaumont St, Oxford OX1 2NA, England.",tuomas.laakkonen@quantinuum.com; k.mei@quantinuum.com; bob.coecke@quantinuum.com,,,,,,,55,0,0,0,0,OPEN PUBL ASSOC,SYDNEY,"OPEN PUBL ASSOC, SYDNEY, 00000, AUSTRALIA",2075-2180,,,ELECTRON P THEOR COM,Electron.

Traditional methods often grapple with the high-dimensional nature of textual data, leading to substantial computational demands. This study introduces a novel classical quantum k-nearest neighbors (CQKNN) algorithm, which integrates quantum circuits into a conventional machine-learning framework to enhance computational efficiency and reduce storage requirements. This hybrid approach uses a unified quantum circuit that simplifies multiple similarity calculations through mid-circuit measurements and qubit reset operations, significantly improving upon traditional multi-circuit quantum k-nearest neighbors (QKNN) models. The CQKNN algorithm, tested on datasets such as SMS Spam Collection, Twitter US Airline Sentiment, and IMDB Movie Reviews, not only outperforms classical KNN but also addresses challenges posed by noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices through advanced error mitigation techniques. This work highlights resource efficiency and reduced gate complexity and demonstrates the practical application of fidelity in quantum similarity calculations, setting new standards for quantum-enhanced machine learning and advancing current quantum technology capabilities in complex data classification tasks. This study presents a novel classical quantum k-nearest neighbors (CQKNN) algorithm with a unified circuit design, optimized for high-dimensional text classification. Incorporating practical fidelity measures, mid-circuit measurements, and qubit reset operations, it significantly reduces quantum gate and qubit use, enhancing efficiency on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

The main challenges consist in finding the most adequate ways of encoding words and their interactions on a quantum computer, considering hardware constraints, as well as building algorithms that take advantage of quantum architectures, so as to show improvement on the performance of natural language tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that starts from a grammar that can be interpreted by means of tensor contraction, to build word representations as quantum states that serve as input to a quantum algorithm. We start by introducing an operator measurement to contract the representations of words, resulting in the representation of larger fragments of text. We then go on to develop pipelines for the tasks of sentence meaning disambiguation and question answering that take advantage of quantum features. For the first task, we show that our contraction scheme deals with syntactically ambiguous phrases storing the various different meanings in quantum superposition, a solution not available on a classical setting. For the second task, we obtain a question representation that contains all possible answers in equal quantum superposition, and we implement Grover's quantum search algorithm to find the correct answer, agnostic to the specific question, an implementation with the potential of delivering a result with quadratic speedup.","[Correia, A.

Specifically, we study memory capacity and accuracy of a quantum reservoir computer based on the fully connected transverse field Ising model by investigating different forms of inter-spin interactions and computing timescales. We show that variation in inter-spin interactions leads to a better memory capacity in general, by engineering the type of interactions the capacity can be greatly enhanced and there exists an optimal timescale at which the capacity is maximized. To connect computational capabilities to physical properties of the underlaying system, we also study the out-of-time-ordered correlator and find that its faster decay implies a more accurate memory.
